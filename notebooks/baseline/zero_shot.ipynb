At least 50 people have lost their lives and 100 others sustained injuries in twin bomb attacks targeting a residential neighborhood in Syrias western city of Homs. Security officials speaking on condition of anonymity said two vehicles laden with explosives went off within less than a minute of each other at a traffic light at al-Siteen Street in al-Zahraa district of the city located 162 kilometers (101 miles) north of the capital Damascus on Sunday morning. A report by the so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the toll could rise further because of the high number of people seriously wounded in the attacks. No group has claimed responsibility for the act of violence so far but such terrorist attacks are usually carried out by the Takfiri militant groups active in the area. In a similar incident last December more than 30 people were killed and 90 others wounded in two bomb explosions that rocked al-Zahraa neighborhood of Homs. The December attack came after foreign-backed militants began evacuating the last district they were controlling in the city under a deal with Damascus. The new fatal bombings come in the wake of significant army gains against Takfiri terror groups on several fronts particularly the northwestern province of Aleppo near the Turkish border. The foreign-sponsored conflict in Syria which flared in March 2011 has claimed the lives of some 470000 people and left 1.9 million injured according to the Syrian Center for Policy Research. Moreover 6.36 million people have been displaced internally and more than four million others have fled the country since the beginning of the conflict. That accounts for 45 percent of the countrys population which has shrunk by 21 percent.

Tags Syria Russia Idlib safe zone Turkey Assad SOHR At least 28 civilians were killed in airstrikes on northwestern Syria despite a planned safe zone. Four children were among the dead in the overnight strikes on the town of Armanaz in Idlib province near the Turkish border the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based watchdog had earlier reported 12 dead in the strikes on the town in Harem district around 20 kilometres northwest of the provincial capital Idlib. Entire apartment blocks had been flattened by the bombardment an AFP correspondent said. The Observatory said it could not immediately determine whether the strikes had been carried out by jets of the Syrian regime or its ally Russia. But they are the latest in an intensifying air campaign carried out by the two governments against jihadist fighters who control most of the province and are not party to a safe zone deal brokered by Russia Turkey and Iran. The surge in bombing raids has forced hospitals in the province to close medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said on Friday. They were triggered by an offensive by jihadist fighters led by al-Qaedas former Syria affiliate launched against regime-held villages in neighbouring Hama province on September 19. The jihadists control nearly all of Idlib province after driving out Islamist former allies earlier this year. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed on Thursday to step up efforts to establish a safe zone in Idlib as part of a wider agreement struck in May. Three other safe zones have already been set up - in Eastern Ghouta near Damascus parts of the south and some areas of the central province of Homs. But in some of those areas too the fighting has continued. Shelling by the army killed at least 21 civilians in Eastern Ghouta on Saturday more than half of them children the Observatory said. The de-escalation agreement excludes both the Islamic State group and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham the alliance dominated by al-Qaedas former Syrian affiliate. The Islamic State group is under attack in its remaining strongholds in eastern Syria by both Russian-backed government forces and US-backed fighters. On Thursday it mounted a counterattack against government forces along their supply lines through the desert to the eastern city of Deir Ezzor. At least 128 troops and militia were killed on Thursday and Friday as the army battled to restore control the Observatory said.

Syrian state TV said an explosive device went off in the northern city of Aleppo killing six people and wounding 30 others. It did not provide further details on Wednesdays blast in the regime-held Salaheddin neighborhood. Opposition media groups including Aleppo Today said the explosion occurred near a mosque during the funeral of a regime fighter. Aleppo was divided between regime and rebel-held districts for years but regime forces managed to drive rebels from the city in December with a Russian-backed offensive. Some contested areas remain. Meanwhile the widely criticized evacuation of thousands of Syrians from four besieged areas resumed Wednesday state media and activists said days after a bombing killed more than 120 evacuees and delayed the population transfer. The Central Military Media said 3000 residents of two pro-regime villages Foua and Kafarya left Wednesday in 45 buses bound for regime-controlled Aleppo. Another 11 buses carrying some 500 people including opposition fighters left Madaya and Zabadani near Damascus heading toward the northern rebel-held Idlib province. The opposition-run Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported the transfer which it said includes 800 armed men from both the rebels and regime. Some 160 mostly gunmen had remained in Zabadani. The process has resumed with 3000 people leaving Foua and Kafraya at dawn and nearly 300 leaving Zabadani and two other rebel-held areas the head of the Britain-based monitoring group Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP. Security was tightened up for Wednesdays departures. Several dozen armed rebel fighters stood guard over the marshalling area where the buses were parked. The AFP correspondent said all other vehicles were carefully searched. After repeated delays the first phase of the deal began on Friday. Some 30 hours after the first two batches reached exchange points a massive explosion struck near buses carrying evacuees from the pro-regime areas killing more than 120 mostly women and children. Many of the rebel fighters who guarded the buses were also killed. No one claimed responsibility for the attack which the regime blamed on the rebels. The transfer deal is not overseen by the United Nations. Critics say the string of evacuations which could see some 30000 people moved across battle lines over the next 60 days rewards siege tactics and amounts to forced displacement along political and sectarian lines. All four areas have been under siege for years their fate linked through a series of reciprocal agreements that the UN says have hindered aid deliveries.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the deaths came in fighting in Hawijat Sakr on the Euphrates River. The clashes took place not far from Deir Ezzor military airport a key remaining post for the Syrian army in the oil-rich province. The Islamic State controls the majority of the province but parts of the provincial capital Deir Ezzor city are still in government hands along with the airport. Deir Ezzor has been a key target of strikes against IS by the US-led coalition fighting the jihadist group in Syria and Iraq. When the raids began IS withdrew from several of its positions and there have been few reports of active clashes involving the group in the province since. Elsewhere in Syria the Observatory reported at least 12 people killed in Syrian regime air strikes on the Ain Tarma area outside the capital Damascus.

The neighbourhood to the east of Damascus is under rebel control and is one of the areas regime forces have been battling to recapture from the opposition around the capital.

The bomb struck Al-Diyabiyah a town that serves as one of the gateways for the many pilgrims from around the world who visit the Shiite holy site. Another 20 people were wounded state news agency SANA reported. The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported the attack and the same death toll. The shrine contains the grave of Sayyeda Zeinab (as) the sister of Imam Hussein (as). The bomb struck a checkpoint near a construction site and left a small crater in the pavement an AFP correspondent reported. One of the guards manning the checkpoint told AFP his bomb detector began beeping when a suspicious pickup truck pulled up. \"We stopped the car at the checkpoint... When we began doing a manual search they detonated the car. My colleagues were killed\" he said. The windows of a small hotel across from the checkpoint had been shattered by the force of the blast.

Three schools were targeted by Russian aircrafts earlier this morning in the town of Ain Jara in rural Aleppo. The Syrian Coalition stressed that the international community must act quickly against Russias flagrant crimes against the Syrian people including children women and the elderly.

The silence of the international community over the crimes of the Assad regime and its allies against Syrian civilians as well as its complete disregard for their blood is a shameful stain on humanity.

The UN Childrens agency (UNICEF) said on Thursday that airstrikes targeting a school in Syrias rebel-held northern Idlib province early on Wednesday may be the deadliest attack on a school since Syrias conflict began nearly six years ago. Both first responders the Syrian Civil Defence and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights have reported that 35 people were killed by the attack which struck a school complex in the village of Hass around midday on Wednesday as children gathered outside preparing to return home. Among the dead were 22 children. UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake has called the airstrikes an \"outrage\" tantamount to a war crime.\" The Syrian Civil Defence or White Helmets have said that the attack constituted a double tap. This occurs when a warplane carries out an initial bombing raid on a target and then waits for either signs of survivors or rescue workers to arrive before executing a second or more consequent attacks. \"One rocket hit the entrance of the school as students were leaving to go home after the school administration decided to end classes for the day because of the raids\" said a local activist speaking to AFP on condition of anonymity.

The agency quoted a United Nations spokesman late on Monday. The spokesman could not confirm if it was an airstrike.

The bombing on Monday evening has trapped civilians in destroyed buildings and the \"White Helmets\" civil defence volunteers are searching for survivors under the rubble a resident told The New Arab. Artillery shelling was also reported to the south of the city. The freeze on fighting brokered by the United States and Russia lasted a week. Syrias armed forces on Monday blamed rebel groups for its failure. \"Syrias army announces the end of the freeze on fighting that began at 7pm (1600 GMT) on September 12 2016 in accordance with the US-Russia agreement\" the statement carried by state news agency SANA said. It said rebel groups \"did not commit to a single element\" of the deal. A contributor to The New Arab based in Aleppo reported at least five regime air raids in the space of ten minutes at around 800pm not long after the end of the ceasefire was announced. The truce had come into force on the evening of September 12. The main battlefronts subsequently saw a marked reduction in violence but clashes broke out late last week in the central provinces of Hama and Homs as well as east of Damascus. The deal was further strained by US-led coalition strikes on Syrian army positions in the east that killed dozens of government soldiers which Washington said was not intentional. On Sunday the cessation of hostilities was hanging by a thread after a fresh wave of air raids hit rebel-held districts of the battleground city of Aleppo killing one woman. These images sent from east Aleppo earlier on Monday by journalist Zouhir al-Shimale show eerily deserted streets as the Syrian armed forces declared the end of the ceasefire.

A mosque was also destroyed by regime airstrikes north of Hama in the west-central region of the country local civil defense sources said Friday. A civil defense official in Idlib Leys el-Faris told Anadolu Agency four civilians were killed and seven others injured in an airstrike which hit the Sermin district. According to Faris a number of residential areas were destroyed in the attack. The Abu Ubaidah Ibn al-Jarrah mosque north of Hama city in Kafr Zeita was also destroyed by Russian airstrikes. \"The regime is intensively attacking rural areas in Idlib and Hama with its allies\" Faris said. Videos and images of the destroyed mosque have been circulating online. Speaking to Anadolu Agency Yusuf el-Bustani a local activist said regime forces were attacking the opposition-controlled Qaboun neighborhood of the capital Damascus. Bustani said four civilians had been injured in the attack. He added local people had difficulties in meeting basic needs due to regime forces attack in East Ghouta. Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests with unexpected ferocity. Several rounds of peace talks - in Geneva and the Kazakh capital Astana - have so far failed to end the conflict in which hundreds of thousands of Syrian civilians are believed to have been killed to date. The namesake of the destroyed mosque Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah was one of the companions of the prophet Muhammad and converted to Islam in 611. Like many of the early Muslims of Mecca Abu Ubaidah experienced hardships because of his faith and migrated to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) with a delegation at Muhammads suggestion. Abu Ubaidah joined Muhammad when the prophet migrated from Mecca to Medina in 622.

Here are some details about the city which was the site of a massacre in 1982: * 1982: - In the late 1970s and early 1980s Syrias Muslim Brotherhood sought to destabilize and unseat President Hafez al-Assad and his government through political assassinations and urban guerilla warfare. In February 1982 the Muslim Brotherhood ambushed government forces searching for dissidents in Hama. - Syrian government forces attacked the city razing the old quarters of Hama to crush the armed uprising by Brotherhood fighters who had taken refuge there. - Estimates of the death toll in the three weeks of operations in Hama vary from 10000 to more than 30000 out of a population of 350000. Syria then imprisoned much of the membership of the local Islamist group. - Syrian human rights groups said that women children and the elderly were among those killed in the crackdown and thousands were forced to flee the city. * 2011: - In June activists said Syrian forces killed at least 60 protesters in the city. Residents said security forces and snipers had fired on crowds of demonstrators. - Assad sacked the governor of Hama province on July 2 a day after tens of thousands of protesters massed in the provincial capital to demand the Syrian leader step down. - The demonstration in Hama was part of nationwide protests which activists said were some of the biggest since the uprising against Assads rule erupted in mid-March. - In a symbolic show of solidarity U.S. ambassador Robert Ford and French ambassador Eric Chevallier visited Hama on July 8 to put pressure on Assad not to crush the protest. Syria condemned the action and summoned them to Damascus on July 10. - Ford had only arrived in Damascus in January. After he posted a letter on the embassys Facebook page a mob stormed the embassy compound July 11 tearing down plaques. - On July 31 a tank-backed assault killed at least 80 people in Hama rights groups said. The state news agency said the military was purging armed groups that were terrorizing citizens. Monday tanks shelled a northeastern district of Hama killing four more civilians two residents said. * ABOUT HAMA: - Hama has been settled as far back as the Bronze Age and Iron Age. Famous for its citadel and its ancient Norias (waterwheels) the younger Assad and his government has sought to promote the city as a tourist destination. - Hama Syrias fourth biggest city has a mostly Sunni Muslim population of 700000.

Tags Syria Damascus Douma Regime Rebels Civilians Bashar al-Assad Airstrikes Syrian regime airstrikes on a rebel-held region near Damascus killed at least 22 civilians on Monday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The highest toll was in Douma the largest town in the Eastern Ghouta region where raids killed 16 civilians including at least one child and wounded 22 it said. Five more civilians were killed in the town of Sabqa and one in the town of Harasta both also in Eastern Ghouta the Observatory said. The Eastern Ghouta region is adjacent to the capitals eastern neighbourhood of Jobar which is divided between regime and rebel control. Last month the armed opposition launched a surprise assault against regime forces from Jobar but was repelled after a week of fighting. Eastern Ghouta has been under a devastating government siege since 2012 which has trapped over 300000 civilains and is targeted regularly by airstrikes and artillery. It is the last remaining opposition stronghold near Damascus where a string of local \"reconciliation deals\" have seen villages and towns brought back under the control of President Bashar al-Assads government. The World Health Organization last week demanded immediate humanitarian access to the area saying residents are in desperate need of medical attention. ïÅTime is running out for the people of East Ghouta. As health needs increase available resources are being depleted day by day. Our main goal now is to provide access to lifesaving care for thousands of vulnerable men women and children immediately said Elizabeth Hoff WHO Representative in Syria. All 3 public hospitals and 17 public health care centres in East Ghouta are nonfunctioning and inaccessible to the population the WHO said in a statement. The regime is fighting to push rebels out of five neighbourhoods in Damascus. The rebels control almost all of Qabun and Tishreen in the northeast as well as half of Jobar in the east. They are also present in Barzeh in the north and Tadamun in the south but the neighbourhoods are covered by a truce with the regime. The Syrian conflict began when the Baath regime in power since 1963 and led by President Bashar al-Assad responded with military force to peaceful protests demanding democratic reforms during the Arab Spring wave of uprisings triggering an armed rebellion fueled by mass defections from the Syrian army.

Syrian children receive treatment following a suspected toxic gas attack in Khan Shaykhun a rebel-held town in the northwestern Syrian Idlib province on April 4 2017. (TRT World and Agencies) International leaders have condemned the alleged chemical attacks which killed at least 58 people including 11 children in Syrias Idlib province on Tuesday. Syrian regime jets pounded the town of Khan Shaykhun. Medics attending the victims said they bore the signs of a gas attack. The war monitor Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said those killed had died from suffocation and the effects of a toxic gas. The weapons used caused many people to choke or faint and some had foam coming out of their mouths SOHR said citing medical sources who described the air strikes as a \"toxic gas attack.\" Fifteen victims mostly women and children were brought to Turkey for treatment. International condemnation Turkeys Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Turkey condemns the suspected chemical attack describing it as a crime against humanity. He said the attack could derail the process of Syrian peace talks being held in Astana Kazakhstan. EUs diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini said the regime of Bashar al Assad bears \"primary responsibility\" for the attack. \"Today the news is awful\" Mogherini said in an interview with media organisations in Brussels on the sidelines of a EU-UN conference that was meant to focus on the post-conflict situation in Syria. French President Francois Hollande accused Assad regime of responsibility for a \"massacre\". \"Once again the Syrian regime will deny the evidence of its responsibility for this massacre\" Hollande said in a statement. The White House also blamed the attack on the regime saying the incident was \"reprehensible and cannot be ignored by the civilised world.\" \"These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the last administrations weakness and irresolution\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer told a briefing. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson also condemned the attack saying those responsible should be \"held to account.\" Drawing criticism from around the world Idlib was also trending globally on social media site Twitter. Russia denies involvement Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed Tuesdays attack Turkish presidential sources said. \"President Erdogan touched on the use of chemical weapons against civilians in Idlib. President Erdogan said such inhumane attacks are unacceptable\" a statement from top residential sources said. However Russia has categorically denied any involvement. \"Planes of the Russian air force have not carried out any strikes near Khan Shaykhun of Idlib province\" said a statement by the Russias defence ministry. The two leaders also have emphasised the importance of the maintenance of an ongoing ceasefire in Syria. TRT Worlds Shamim Chowdhury has the latest from Gaziantep near the Turkish-Syria border. \"Toxic gas attack\" kills at least 58 in Idlib - YouTube Opposition demands UN investigation Syrias opposition National Coalition demanded a UN investigation into the attack. \"The National Coalition demands the [UN] Security Council convene an emergency session ... open an immediate investigation and take the necessary measures to ensure the officials perpetrators and supporters are held accountable\" the body said in a statement. The opposition said on Tuesday that the attack \"calls into question\" the peace process. \"If the United Nations cannot deter the regime from carrying out such crimes how can it achieve a process that leads to political transition in Syria?\" said Mohamad Sabra the head negotiator for the main opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC) that participated in recent peace talks in Geneva. The regime military source denied that its forces used any such weapons saying the army \"does not and has not\" used chemical weapons \"not in the past and not in the future.\" Meanwhile a rocket has slammed into a hospital in northwestern Syria on Tuesday as doctors treated victims of the suspected chemical attack destroying part of the building.

Among the dead were four staff and five children. \"The direct bombing of another hospital in Syria is an outrage said Silvia Dallatomasina MSFs medical manager of operations in northwest Syria while also calling for an immediate end to attacks on hospitals in Syrias war. MSF said that the hospital in Millis Idlib province was hit directly by two airstrikes that forced the closure of the medical facility. The hospital served as a referral centre specialising in pediatrics with an operating theatre and an intensive care unit. MSF did not specify which government was behind the attacks however Russia was on Monday accused of dropping phosphorous bombs on central Idlib late Sunday night. The bombings came as rebel groups on the ground prepared for fresh assaults on regime positions. The medical charity said that the attack has deprived around 70000 people in Millis and the surrounding towns of medical care as it used to cater for up to 250 people a day. Hospitals have been regularly targeted in Syrias conflict with the UN recording 44 attacks in July alone on medical facilities in the war-torn country. The government of President Bashar al-Assad and his allies in Moscow have denied bombing hospitals in their campaigns against rebel groups. According to MSF two medical centres that it supports in Idlib have reported a total of nice mass influxes of injured people in July. In this month alone 466 patients have been reported as wounded and 37 have died.

Tags Russia Syria Assad Deir az-Zour Islamic State SOHR At least 53 civilians including 21 children perished early Sunday morning when Russian air strikes hit \"residential buildings\" in a village held by the Islamic State group in eastern Syria a monitor said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strikes hit the village of Al-Shafah in Deir az-Zour province on the eastern bank of the Euphrates River. The Observatory relies on a network of sources inside Syria and says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. The monitor had initially given a death toll of 34 civilians but the number spiked after more bodies were recovered. \"The toll increased after removing the debris in a long day of rescue operation\" Rami Abdel Rahman head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told AFP adding the strikes hit \"residential buildings\". At least 18 people were also wounded in the air raids he added. Russia is a close ally of Syrias President Bashar al-Assad and in September 2015 began a military intervention in support of his government that has gradually helped Damascus regain territory. Syrias Deir az-Zour is one of the last places IS jihadists hold territory in the country after being driven from their major strongholds including their one-time de facto Syrian capital Raqqa city. The oil-rich eastern province that borders Iraq was once almost completely under IS control but the jihadists now hold just nine percent of Deir az-Zour according to the Observatory. They have faced two separate offensives there one led by the regime with Russian backing and the other by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters. Russia in drivers seat The latest strikes come as the United Nations tries to revitalise its flagging efforts to end a six-year civil war that has left Syria devastated and huge swathes of its population refugees. Syrias Deir az-Zour [click to enlarge] On Tuesday the eighth round of UN-brokered talks will kick off. They have achieved little so far but may be bolstered by the oppositions decision to bring a unified delegation to Geneva for the first time. For progress to happen rival sides will need to overcome the hurdle that has derailed past discussions the fate of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. He retains Moscows support but is loathed by much of Syrias rebel opposition who want him gone. Backed by Russias decisive military support Assads government has regained control of 55 percent of the country including major cities Damascus Aleppo Homs and Hama and around two-thirds of the population lives in regime-held areas. The rest is carved up between rebel factions jihadists and Kurdish forces. Some experts believe that Russia has clearly put itself in the drivers seat in recent months especially as US President Donald Trumps administration has pulled back from Syrian diplomatic front. Russia fellow regime ally Iran and rebel-backer Turkey have hosted negotiations in the Kazakh capital Astana that led to the creation of four \"de-escalation zones\" which produced a drop in violence though deadly air strikes and battles continue in some areas. And this week Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a \"congress\" of Syrian regime and opposition figures a move backed by Ankara and Tehran. The Syrian conflict began when the Baath regime in power since 1963 and led by Assad responded with military force to peaceful protests demanding democratic reforms during the Arab Spring wave of uprisings triggering an armed rebellion fuelled by mass defections from the Syrian army. The brutal tactics pursued mainly by the regime which have included the use of chemical weapons sieges mass executions and torture against civilians have led to war crimes investigations.

Russian military jets are seen at Hmeymim air base in Syria June 18 2016 (TRT World and Agencies) The death toll from Russian and Syrian strikes in the opposition-held city of Al Quriyah has risen to 82 people including 58 civilians the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Sunday. \"Three Russian and Syrian regime air raids on the region of Al-Quriyah southeast of Deir Ezzor city killed 58 civilians\" the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The rights group added that 24 other people were killed without specifying whether they were civilians or DAESH fighters. DAESH holds around 60 percent of Deir Ezzor city the capital of the province of the same name which is next to the jihadist-held Raqqa province. Government forces were also fighting rebels in northern neighbourhoods of the city in a bid to halt rocket fire on government-held districts. Elsewhere in Syria in Manbij US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) overran a key road junction in the citys south after capturing nearby grain silos overnight. Manbij lies in the eastern plains of Aleppo province which has become a battleground between an array of competing armed groups including Al-Qaeda non-jihadist rebels and government forces as well as the SDF and DAESH. Members of Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) attend the funeral of eight fellow fighters who died during an assault against the Islamic State (IS) group in the town of Manbij on June 24 2016. (AFP) The Raqa Revolutionaries Brigades - one of the Arab components of the Kurdish-dominated alliance - also said the SDF had seized the silos and pushed into the city. In 2014 DAESH took control of Manbij it was a key transit point for foreign fighters and funds as well as a trafficking hub for oil antiquities and other plundered goods. The SDF launched its offensive to take Manbij on May 31 driving across the Euphrates River from the east with military advice from some 200 US special forces troops. According to the Observatory DAESH has lost 463 fighters in the battle and the SDF has lost at least 89. A two-day freeze on fighting brokered by Moscow and Washington this month expired without renewal.

Activists in Aleppo said that the Iranian militias summarily executed six young men in the neighborhood of Sakhour on Friday after those men returned to their homes in eastern Aleppo which completely fell to regime forces. Member of the Syrian Coalitions political committee Yasser Farhan said that the Free Syrian Army and forces of the Syrian revolution will continue to resist the Russian and Iranian invaders until they are ousted from of all Syrian territory. Activists in rural Aleppo said that the Assad regime and Russian air forces having finished the brutal bombing campaign on eastern Aleppo carried out intense airstrikes on western Aleppo over the past two days. Six civilians from one family were killed in airstrikes on the town of Atareb west of Aleppo on Saturday. Regime forces have also significantly escalated aerial and artillery bombardment on Wadi Barada valley northwest of Damascus pounding the rebel-held enclave with tens of barrel bombs and airstrikes over the past two days. Farhan stressed that the international community has a responsibility to stop such crimes pointing out that Russia is still not able to control the situation in Syria or sponsor any peace process. Farhan raised questions about the UN Security Council resolution passed earlier this week which called for the deployment of UN observers in Aleppo. He said that the latest resolution has not yet been implemented just as earlier UNSC resolutions on Syria which called for stopping attacks on civilians; unhindered delivery of aid to besieged and hard-to-reach areas; and the release of detainees were not implemented. Iran is seeking to consolidate its presence in Syria through the deployment of sectarian foreign militias in key areas across the country Farhan warned.

The Syrian Network for Human Rights said in a report released today that ISIS had forced at least 33000 residents out of their homes in the town of Abu Hamam in rural Deir Ezzor since 10 August 2014. According to report ISIS has executed around 367 people in the town while 240 more have gone missing. The Syrian Coalition has previously condemned the heinous crime committed by ISIS in eastern rural Deir Ezzor where residents discovered a mass grave containing 230 corpses of tribesmen who were summarily executed by ISIS in late 2014. The area was the scene of fierce battles between the Shaitat tribesmen and ISIS militants who eventually took control of the area and rounded up hundreds of tribesmen and executed them on charges of apostasy. The Syrian Coalition stresses that modern dictatorships have left nothing but a legacy of mass graves death and destruction. Four years have passed since Assad embarked on his brutal campaign on the Syrian people and now ISIS to pursue the same campaign and one can hardly find any difference between the two in terms of the scale of their criminality and barbarity.

Rebel groups including the powerful Ahrar al-Sham faction and former Al-Qaeda affiliate Fateh al-Sham Front fired waves of rockets into government-held western Aleppo killing at least 15 civilians a monitor said. The rebels also targeted government positions east of Aleppo city and in the coastal province of Latakia including the Hmeimim military base used by Russian forces allied with the regime. Moscow says it has not bombed Aleppo since October 18 but senior Russian military official Sergei Rudskoi told a briefing Friday that the military had asked President Vladimir Putin for authorisation to resume its air strikes. \"We have appealed to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation with a request to resume air strikes\" Rudskoi said. But the Kremlin said Putin did not agree. \"The Russian president considers it inappropriate at the current moment to resume strikes on Aleppo\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said adding that Putin thought it was necessary to \"continue the humanitarian pause\" in the war-ravaged city. \"The Russian side retains the right in case of extreme necessity to use all the troops and facilities it has to carry out support of the Syrian armed forces at the necessary level\" he added. Fridays rebel assault comes more than three months into a government siege of eastern Aleppo where more than 250000 people live and several weeks after the army began an operation to retake the rebel east. Rebel groups \"announce the start of the battle to break the siege of Aleppo\" said Abu Yusef Muhajir a military commander and spokesman for Ahrar al-Sham. The assault \"will end the regime occupation of western Aleppo and break the siege on the people trapped inside\" he told AFP. \"The breaking of the siege is inevitable\" said Yasser al-Yusef a member of the political office of the Nureddine al-Zinki rebel group. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitor said at least 15 civilians including a woman and two children had been killed and more than 100 wounded in rebel fire on western Aleppo. The monitor reported fierce clashes on multiple fronts on the western and southern outskirts of west Aleppo with three suicide car bombs targeting a checkpoint in the Dahiyet al-Assad neighbourhood. Fighting was continuing in the area near a military academy it said but had no immediate toll. An AFP correspondent in east Aleppo said the assault had boosted morale in rebel-held districts with mosques broadcasting \"God is greatest\" from loudspeakers. He said residents burned tyres to create smoke and provide cover against air attack. Heavy rain put the fires out but also hampered Syrian air operations creating what one rebel dubbed \"a divine no-fly zone\". The Observatory said rebels had also fired dozens of rockets at the Nairab military airport and Aleppo international airport both east of the city and government-controlled. Rebels also fired rockets from Idlib province into the government stronghold of Latakia killing one person and wounding six. Rockets struck close to the Hmeimim military airport as well as near President Bashar al-Assads ancestral village Qardaha the monitor said. State television said \"the army has foiled an attempt by terrorists to attack Aleppo city from several axes with suicide bomb attacks and has inflicted losses on them\". State news agency SANA said government planes were carrying out air strikes south and west of Aleppo. Once Syrias economic powerhouse Aleppo has been ravaged by the conflict that began in March 2011 with anti-government protests and has since killed more than 300000 people. Aleppo has been divided between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012 and in September the army announced an operation to recapture the whole city. The UNs aid chief Stephen OBrien this week said Aleppo had become \"a kill zone\" adding that \"nothing is actually happening to stop the war stop the suffering\". Last week Russia implemented a three-day \"humanitarian truce\" intended to allow civilians and surrendering rebels to leave the east. But few did so and a UN plan to evacuate the wounded failed because security could not be guaranteed. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused UN agencies Friday of \"not being professional enough\" over Aleppo. Speaking in Moscow after meeting the Syrian and Iranian foreign ministers he said \"Their inaction allowed the medical evacuation to be sabotaged.\" UN chief Ban Ki-moon meanwhile condemned an attack on a school in government-held west Aleppo on Thursday that killed at killed at least six children according to state media. \"Such attacks if deliberate may amount to war crimes\" he said in a statement.', 'credibility_signals': {'evidence': {'label': 0.0, 'question': 'Does this text fail to present any supporting evidence or arguments to substantiate its claims?', 'confidence': 0.8, 'explanation': 'The article provides various details about the events in Aleppo, including statements from military officials and reports from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Cross-border artillery fire by Turkish troops destroyed at least six weapon caches and one armed vehicle it said. The Turkish military has repeatedly targeted northern Syria with artillery shells guided missiles and mortars to hit militants who Ankara says have fired rockets at southern Turkish border towns. There have also been reports of operations by Turkeys Special Forces inside the Syrian territory. Turkey has also hinted at establishing a safe zone in the 98-kilometer (60-mile) stretch between Manbij in Aleppo Province and the Turkish border prompting objections from Iran and Russia. The US has supported the plan describing it as part of a deepening campaign by the Turkish army to push ISIS away from a vital 60-mile stretch of the Turkey-Syria border that serves as the groups main lifeline. Turkey and the US however do not see eye to eye on Washingtons support for Kurdish militants in northern Syria. Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said last week Turkey would not allow cooperation with terrorist organizations in Syria referring to Kurdish groups which the US supports. Turkey says the fighters are a terrorist organization affiliated with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) but the US sees them as a partner in Syria operations.

The attack on the town of Khan Sheikhun killed at least 58 civilians and saw dozens suffering respiratory problems and symptoms including vomiting fainting and foaming at the mouth the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said. Syrias opposition blamed President Bashar Assads forces saying the attack cast doubt on the future of peace talks. The army denied any involvement however issuing a statement blaming \"terrorist groups\" for using \"chemical and toxic substances\". At least 11 children were among the dead the observatory said and an AFP correspondent in Khan Sheikhun saw many attached to respirators. If confirmed it would be one of the worst chemical attacks since the start of Syrias civil war six years ago. The incident brought swift international condemnation with the United States France and Britain all pointing the finger at Assad. US blames Damascus The White House condemned what it said was a \"reprehensible\" attack carried out by Assads forces. Spokesman Sean Spicer said President Donald Trump had been briefed extensively on the incident adding that the US was \"confident in its assessment\" that Damascus was to blame. Spicer also suggested it was in the \"best interest\" of Syrians for Assad not to lead the country. UN envoy Staffan de Mistura said the attack was believed to be chemical and launched from the air adding that there should be a \"clear identification of responsibilities and accountability\". The observatory said the attack on a residential part of Khan Sheikhun came early on Tuesday morning when a warplane carried out strikes that released \"toxic gas\". As well as those killed at least 160 people were injured it said and many were dying even after arriving at medical facilities. The monitor could not confirm the nature of the gas but said the attack was likely carried out by government warplanes. We heard strikes this morning... We ran inside the houses and saw whole families just dead in their beds. Children women old people dead in the streets resident Abu Mustafa said. Russias military which has been fighting in support of Assads government since September 2015 denied carrying out any strikes near the town. Hours after the initial attack air strikes also hit a hospital in the town where doctors were treating victims the AFP correspondent said bringing down rubble on top of medics as they worked. He saw a young girl a woman and two elderly people dead at a hospital. A father carried his dead little girl her lips blueish and her dark curls visible wrapped in a sheet. As doctors worked a warplane circled overhead striking first near the facility and then hitting it twice inflicting severe damage and prompting nearly a dozen medical staff to flee. Speaking to AFP medic Hazem Shehwan said victims were suffering from symptoms including pinpoint pupils convulsions foaming at the mouth and rapid pulses. Army denial Khan Sheikhun is in Idlib province which is largely controlled by an alliance of rebels including former Al Qaeda affiliate Fateh Al Sham Front. The province is regularly targeted in government and Russian air strikes and has also been hit by the US-led coalition fighting Daesh group usually targeting extremists. Syrias leading opposition group the National Coalition blamed Assad for the attack and demanded the UN open an immediate investigation and hold those responsible to account. Failure to do so will be understood as a message of blessing to the regime for its actions it said. Damascus officially joined the Chemical Weapons Convention and turned over its declared chemical arsenal in 2013 as part of a deal to avert US military action. That agreement came after hundreds of people up to 1429 according to a US intelligence report were killed in chemical weapons strikes allegedly carried out by government troops east and southwest of Damascus. But there have been repeated allegations of chemical weapons use since with a UN-led investigation pointing the finger at the regime for at least three chlorine attacks in 2014 and 2015. The army again denied using chemical weapons on Tuesday insisting it has never used them any time anywhere and will not do so in the future. The global chemical arms watchdog said it was seriously concerned by reports of the attack. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it was gathering and analysing information from all available sources. The UNs Commission of Inquiry for Syria said it had begun investigating the alleged use of chemical weapons. Peace talks doubts More than 320000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests. Successive rounds of peace talks including a UN-sponsored meeting in Geneva last week have failed to produce a political breakthrough. Tuesdays attack cast new doubt on the peace process said the oppositions chief negotiator Mohamad Sabra. If the United Nations cannot deter the regime from carrying out such crimes how can it achieve a process that leads to political transition in Syria? he told AFP. A senior Syrian security source told AFP that opposition forces were trying to achieve in the media what they could not achieve on the ground by spreading images from the alleged attack site. The UN Security Council is to hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss the attack following calls from France and Britain. Ive seen the reports about the use of sarin and as far as I know they have not been confirmed the British ambassador to the UN Matthew Rycroft said. This is clearly a war crime Rycroft told reporters.

Decrying an affront to humanity President Donald Trump declared Wednesday that a chemical weapons attack in Syria cannot be tolerated but did not say what the US might do in response. He blamed the attack squarely on Syrian President Bashar Assad. Trump speaking alongside Jordans King Abdullah II in the Rose Garden offered no details about what steps the US might take in response even as his UN ambassador Nikki Haley was promising a strong and perhaps even unilateral response. But Trump said the attack was so horrific and noted that it had killed innocent people small children and even beautiful little babies. These heinous actions by the Assad regime cannot be tolerated Trump said. He said the US stood with its global allies to condemn this horrific attack. The United States and Russia were trading conflicting assertions Wednesday about who launched a chemical weapons attack in Syria that killed 72 people as world leaders grasped for a response to the latest atrocity in Syrias intractable civil war. President Donald Trump accompanied by first lady Melania Trump and Queen Rania shakes hands with Jordans King Abdullah II in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington Wednesday April 5 2017. (AP) As Trump stood by his charge that Assads forces were responsible Russia disagreed. The staunch Assad ally insisted that the chemicals were dispersed when Syrian warplanes bombed a facility where rebels were building chemical weapons. At the United Nations Trumps envoy threatened unilateral US action if the world body failed to act. When the United Nations consistently fails in its duty to act collectively there are times in the life of states that we are compelled to take our own action Haley declared. She addressed an emergency meeting of the Security Council which was weighing a resolution condemning chemical weapons use in Syria. Russia which has veto power is opposed. Yet in Moscow Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova focused her attention elsewhere: Its necessary to demand that the rebels offer full access to study the area and collect necessary information. Leaders and officials in other countries including Britain and Israel joined the US in saying Assads forces were responsible. A US official said an American review of radar and other assessments showed Syrian aircraft flying in the area at the time of the attack. Russian and coalition aircraft were not there at that time said the official who wasnt authorized to discuss intelligence publicly and requested anonymity. Washington hasnt yet concluded what type of chemical was used. On Tuesday President Donald Trump split the blame between Syrias embattled leader and former President Barack Obama for the countrys worst chemical weapons attack in years. While calling the attack reprehensible and intolerable Trump said Obama did nothing after Assad crossed the former US leaders red line in 2013. These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the past administrations weakness and irresolution Trump said. The political tone of Trumps statement took many US officials by surprise. They noted that US presidents have rarely attacked their predecessors so aggressively for events like chemical weapons attacks that Democrats and Republicans both abhor. Several officials involved in internal administration discussions said Trumps National Security Council had been preparing a different statement until the presidents closest advisers took over the process. The officials werent authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity. The presidents eldest daughter and top adviser Ivanka Trump took a more compassionate tone tweeting Wednesday Heartbroken and outraged by the images coming out of Syria following the atrocious chemical attack yesterday. At least 72 people died in the town of Khan Sheikhoun. The World Health Organization said victims seemed to show symptoms consistent with nerve agent exposure.

Jeb el-Kussa is located 14 kilometers (almost nine miles) south of Jarabulus and is controlled by fighters from the area backed by Kurdish forces. Some of the fighters were killed in Sundays shelling and air strikes but the number was not yet clear said the Observatory a Britain-based monitor with a network of sources on the ground. On Saturday clashes erupted for the first time between Turkish forces backed by tanks and pro-Kurdish fighters in the town of Al-Amarneh also south of Jarabulus.

More than 40 people were also wounded in the attack on the Sheikh Maqsoud area the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a district next to the only way in and out of rebel-held parts of the northern city the Castello road. An escalation in air and artillery strikes in recent weeks around the road has made it virtually impassable putting hundreds of thousands of people in Aleppo under effective siege. Hundreds of people have been killed in Aleppo since peace talks broke off in April as Syrias President Bashar al-Assad seeks to regain control of what was Syrias largest pre-war city now split between rebel and government sectors. Rebels have said in the past their attacks on Sheikh Maqsoud were in response to YPG attempts to cut the Castello road. The YPG controls nearly all of Syrias northern frontier with Turkey and has been a close ally of the United States in the campaign against Islamic State (IS) group in Syria. Many rebels in western Syria do not trust the YPG because they say it cooperates with Damascus rather than fighting it an accusation the YPG has denied. Heavy Bombardment Sheikh Maqsoud has been under intense bombardment since mid-February which has killed more than 132 civilians and injured around 900 more the Observatory said.

The villages are near a main highway within rebel territory linking Aleppo with the capital Damascus to the south. They lie in an area captured by government forces at the end of last year in a large offensive assisted by Iranian-backed militias and Russian air power. But the Syrian Observatory said there has been a lack of Russian air support during this weeks battle for these villages. At least 86 members of Syrian government forces and its allies - who include members of the Lebanese group Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed militias - were killed in fighting in the south Aleppo area in the past four days the Observatory said.

Residents in the area blamed the U.S.-led coalition for the strikes that targeted two villages Tokhar and Hoshariyeh which are controlled by IS activists said. The villages are near the Daesh stronghold of Manbij a town that members of the PYD-dominated U.S.-backed Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) have been trying to capture in a weeks-long offensive. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 56 civilians including 11 children were killed in the strikes on the villages which also wounded dozens. Another activist group the Local Coordination Committees said dozens of civilians mostly families were killed. Turkeys official Anadolu Agency put the death toll at least at 85 adding that 50 civilians were also wounded in airstrikes. The Daesh-linked Aamaq news agency claimed 160 civilians mostly women and children were killed in Tokhar alone in a series of purportedly American airstrikes around dawn Tuesday. Postings on a Facebook page show images of people including children as they were being put in collective grave purportedly in the village of Tokhar. One photograph shows a man carrying the lifeless body of a child covered with dust while another shows a child partly covered by a blanket lying in a grave. Tuesdays casualties come on the heels of similar airstrikes on the Daesh-held town of Manbij on Monday when at least 15 civilians were reportedly killed. Meanwhile the headquarters of Daesh militants inside Manbij was captured as SDF forces pushed into the western part of the town over the weekend the U.S. military said in a statement on Tuesday. The headquarters which was located in a hospital was being used as a command center and logistics hub. The U.S.-backed Syrian rebels also took control of part of the town enabling civilians in the area to flee the fighting the statement said. The rebels were continuing to battle Daesh on four fronts for control of Manbij clearing territory as they pushed toward the center of the city the statement said. Daesh militants have staged counterattacks but the Syrian rebels have maintained momentum with the help of air strikes by the U.S.-led coalition the statement said. It said the coalition has carried out more than 450 air strikes around Manbij since the operation to take the town began. The U.S. Central Command said the coalition conducted 18 strikes on Monday and destroyed 13 Daesh fighting positions seven Daesh vehicles and two car bombs near Manbij. The Manbij area has seen intense battles between Daesh extremists and the Kurdish-led fighters who have been advancing under the cover of intense airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition. If Manbij is captured by the U.S.-backed fighters it will be the biggest strategic defeat for Daesh in Syria since July 2015 when the extremist group lost the border town of Tal Abyad. In neighboring Iraq meanwhile Daesh has been beaten back on several fronts with Iraqi forces aided by U.S.-led coalition airstrikes having retaken the cities of Ramadi and Fallujah in western Anbar province.', 'credibility_signals': {'evidence': {'label': 0.0, 'question': 'Does this text fail to present any supporting evidence or arguments to substantiate its claims?', 'confidence': 0.8, 'explanation': 'The article presents various claims about civilian casualties and airstrikes, supported by multiple sources including activist groups and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

(TRT World and Agencies) Syrian rebel forces advanced into a key regime-held district in Aleppo on Monday to reopen the last remaining supply route into opposition-held districts. The offensive to gain control of the strategic Castello Road in the Al Mallah district came at dawn just days after the area was encircled by regime forces. Control over the Castello Road is the only way that some 250000 besieged residents of east Aleppo can have access to essentials like food and fuel. The regimes capture of the district days ago had come during an extension of a nationwide truce declared last week by the regime to mark the Muslim holiday of Eid al Fitr. The regime which has been gaining ground on the rebels after Russia launched air strikes in support of regime leader Bashar al Assads forces last year have continued to step up their military campaigns on major battle fronts this month despite periodically announcing temporary truces. A Syrian man sells parsley at an empty vegetable market in the opposition-held area of the northern Syrian city of Aleppo on July 10 2016 after the regime closed the Castello Road severing the supply route to the opposition-held eastern half of the city. (AFP) Residents contacted in the city say prices of the little remaining vegetables bread and fuel had almost doubled in the past week with no new supplies coming into Aleppo Syrias largest city and commercial hub before the war. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said air raids by regime forces on the opposition-held part of Aleppo killed 13 civilians on Monday. It also said that 19 regime fighters were killed in the fighting. Aleppo has bore the brunt of the war which began in 2011 after regime forces led a crackdown on anti-regime protesters. The war has since killed more than 300000 people with some estimates suggesting 470000 may have died. A series of peace talks were brokered by the UN in February to bring peace to Aleppo and other parts of the country but long-lasting ceasefires have not held. UN calls US and Russia to bring peace to Syria The siege by regime forces on eastern Aleppo has alarmed humanitarian workers. United Nations Deputy Spokesman Farhan Haq said the UN is extremely concered about the unfolding situation in Syria. Battle rages near Aleppo as rebels encircled Ali Mustafa reports - YouTube UN envoy Staffan de Mistura however says he is still optimistic to end the six-year-old war with the help of international support. \"My message is for Russian and for the US. Now more than ever. Because it is them who have produced and given their contributrion to making sure at least for two months that the ceasefire was agreed upon\" he said referring to the cessation of hostilities deal. On the other hand the main Syrian opposition body the High Negotiations Committee (HNC) told the UN envoy that it was premature to set a date for fresh talks in which outlines of a political deal will be presented something Mistura is seeking ahead of an August deadline. \"There is a need to adopt a new strategy to push the peace process by adopting a tougher policy against the regimes violations against the Syrian people ... before calling for a new round of negotiations\" the HNC statement said.

At least 123 civilians have been killed in the besieged suburb by airstrikes and shelling since the Syrian regime and Russian jets began an offensive nearly two weeks ago the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. A witness told Reuters that there had been drones in the sky since Sunday morning with warplanes heavily bombing the towns of Mesraba Harasta and Eastern Ghouta killing at least 19 civilians. The opposition Eastern Ghouta Damascus Countryside local council said this week that the intensifying bombardments were forcing people to seek shelter in unsuitable and unsanitary places which it feared could lead to disease outbreaks. Eastern Ghouta has been under siege by Syrian regime forces since 2013 and no food aid convoys have entered the town of Douma since wheat flour rations in August. Civilians are eating rubbish fainting from hunger and forcing their children to eat on alternate days because of the food shortage the UN World Food Programme said this week. Nearly 174500 people trapped in the town of Douma since September have been forced to adopt emergency \"coping strategies\" the UN said.

Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighters walk in Tal Samin village north of Raqqa city Syria November 19 2016. REUTERS/Rodi Said The advance is part of a military campaign backed by an international coalition led by the United States to drive Islamic State from its Syrian capital of Raqqa. It follows SDF gains against the jihadist group across the north of the country. The strongest group in the SDF is the Peoples Protection Units or YPG a Kurdish militia but Washington has said that any operation to retake Raqqa should be predominantly Arab the ethnicity of most of the citys residents. The latest advances in the countryside about 50 km (30 miles) west and northwest of Raqqa follow an earlier phase of SDF gains on another front about 30 km north of the city. Three SDF soldiers were killed fighting Islamic State after the capture of five villages the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based war monitor said on Monday. Islamic State had been on the back foot in both Syria and Iraq where it is under attack in Mosul its biggest and most important possession and after a string of U.S. air strikes that have killed many of its leaders this year. However earlier this month it launched a surprise attack 160 km southwest of Raqqa to retake the ancient desert city of Palmyra which it had lost in March to Syrian army forces backed by Russian air power after a nine-month occupation. That attack demonstrated the risks still posed by the group across Syria even after its territorial losses there since mid-2015 including holdings along the Turkish border which were once its main route for supplies and recruits. Complicating the efforts against Islamic State is a second campaign being waged against it in northwest Syria by Turkey and Syrian rebel groups allied to Ankara. This has taken a large area from the jihadist group but is also aimed at stopping Kurdish expansion. The Turkish-backed Syrian rebels are now attempting to capture the city of al-Bab from Islamic State a move that will end Kurdish hopes of uniting their two separated areas of self rule in northern Syria. Early on Monday the Turkish military said one of its soldiers had been killed in a car bomb in al-Bab on Sunday and that 11 militants were also killed in clashes that day.

The attack came as Syrian opposition fighters and their allies battled government forces outside Aleppo in a bid to ease the regimes siege of rebel-held parts of the northern city. Russias defence ministry announced the downing of the helicopter which it said was carrying three crew and two officers. \"A Russian Mi-8 military transport helicopter was shot down from the ground after delivering humanitarian aid to Aleppo\" the defence ministry said in a statement quoted by Russian news agencies. The Kremlin said all five people on board were assumed dead. \"As far as we know from the information weve had from the defence ministry those in the helicopter died they died heroically because they were trying to move the aircraft away to minimise victims on the ground\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. Lieutenant General Sergei Rudskoy called the downing a \"terrorist act\" and said the defence ministry was still trying to confirm the fate of the Russian servicemen \"through all possible channels\". It was not immediately clear who was responsible. The incident was the deadliest single attack on Russian forces in Syria since Moscow began its intervention in support of President Bashar Assads government last September. It brought the total number of members of the Russian forces killed in Syria to 18. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitor said the helicopter had come down along the administrative border between Idlib province in the northwest and neighbouring Aleppo. Idlib is held almost entirely by a powerful coalition of Islamist and jihadist forces including the former Al Nusra Front now known as the Fateh Al Sham Front after renouncing its status as Al Qaedas Syrian affiliate. Aleppo rebel assault In neighbouring Aleppo province the Fateh Al Sham Front and allied rebel groups were fighting fierce battles on Monday against regime troops on the outskirts of Aleppo city. The clashes are part of an assault launched Sunday to try to ease a government siege of the rebel-held east of the city. The observatory said the rebels had advanced overnight south and southwest of Aleppo but reported ongoing fighting as well as government air strikes on the battlefield and rebel-held eastern neighbourhoods. Once Syrias economic powerhouse Aleppo city has been roughly divided between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012. In recent weeks government forces have encircled the east cutting the sole supply route in and raising fears of a humanitarian crisis for the estimated 250000 people now under siege there. The primary goal of the rebel assault is to seize the Ramussa neighbourhood on the citys southern outskirts. The road that runs through Ramussa is the main supply route for regime forces going to the areas they control in western Aleppo said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. It is also used by civilians to enter and leave government-controlled districts of Aleppo. Taking a detour from the north would be too dangerous he added. Islamist group Ahrar Al Sham said on Twitter it was involved in fierce clashes near Ramussa and advancing towards the route. State news agency SANA said rebel rocket and sniper fire near Ramussa on Monday killed four people including three women. The observatory put the toll at six dead. Humanitarian corridors SANA said people were using the route as usual but residents of western Aleppo expressed fears that the assault could cut them off. If the militants break the siege they will besiege us and cut the Khanasser route which is the only artery we have said Hossam Qassab a 32-year-old pharmacist. A Syrian security source acknowledged the assault but said government forces had repelled it. The encirclement of eastern Aleppo has raised fears of starvation for remaining residents who have reported food shortages and spiralling prices since the government siege began on July 17. Last week Moscow announced the opening of humanitarian corridors from the east into government territory for civilians and surrendering rebels. On Saturday Moscow and Syrian official media reported dozens of civilians had fled via these corridors but residents and rebels on the ground dismissed the reports as lies. Elsewhere in Aleppo province the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance advanced inside the Daesh terror group bastion of Manbij on Monday the observatory reported. The SDF hold approximately 40 per cent of the town and are fighting to take it with support from the US-led coalition against Daesh.', 'credibility_signals': {'evidence': {'label': 0.0, 'question': 'Does this text fail to present any supporting evidence or arguments to substantiate its claims?', 'confidence': 0.8, 'explanation': 'The article provides specific details about the incident, including statements from the Russian defense ministry and the Kremlin, as well as information from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

An ISIL terrorist car bomb attack killed at least 44 and injured 140 others on Wednesday in al-Qameshli city in Hasaka province. SANA news agency quoted a source in Hasaka as saying that a terrorist suicide bomber carried out the attack using a car bomb in al-Gharbiya neighborhood on the road between al-Hialiyeh roundabout and Youth City roundabout on the western part of the city. The source said that scores of people were killed and injured in the attack and that a number of residential buildings and the infrastructure in the area sustained severe damage. Medical sources in the city told SANAs reporter that al-Qamishli National Hospital and a number of private hospitals received the bodies of 44 victims as well as 140 injured people some of whom sustained severe injuries which means that the death toll is likely to rise. For its part the Takfiri ISIL group claimed responsibility for the attack. In a statement circulated on social media it said the attack was carried out by a bomber in an explosives-laden truck.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the bombing campaign has killed hundreds mostly civilians and forced thousands of families to flee their homes. \"The number of people killed in an air strike this morning against the market area of Atareb village has risen to 21 including three children\" said the Observatory adding the toll was likely to rise. Activists distributed video showing scenes of chaos with bodies lying amid mounds of grey rubble in what was clearly a market. The amateur footage shows a woman in a white headscarf screaming as she leaned over the body of a loved one. Another image showed a man attending to a boy whose leg had been ripped off. It was unclear whether the child was alive or dead. \"The area that was struck today is a market area thats why there were so many civilians killed\" said Aleppo-based activist Abu Omar. \"The regime is hitting back against the civilians who support the revolt\" against President Bashar al-Assad he added. Swathes of Aleppo city and province have been out of army control since 2012. Human Rights Watch has accused Syrias regime of \"wreaking disaster\" with its air strikes on the area.

The Syrian regime has intensified its campaign against the last rebel holdouts on the outskirts of the capital as Russian-sponsored talks in Kazakhstan aim to consolidate de-escalation zones in different parts of the country. The limited local truces are aimed at freezing the lines of the six-year-old civil war which has claimed an estimated 400000 lives and allowing humanitarian aid to flow into besieged areas. The Ghouta Media Center and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least five children were killed when a shell landed at the gate of a school in Jisreen a town in the eastern Ghouta suburbs of Damascus as children were leaving for the day. The Observatory said the death toll is likely to rise and that another child was killed in the village from another shell. One of the children had his legs blown off. Shelling in the northeastern town of Musraba has meanwhile killed another three people including a child according to the Observatory. The Ghouta Media Center said four were killed including two children. Another shell in Harasta also in the eastern Ghouta suburbs landed near a school but only caused injuries. Eastern Ghouta which is still home to an estimated 350000 people has endured years of siege and shelling which has continued despite a de-escalation agreement backed by the regime and its close allies Russia and Iran. On Monday the United Nations said it reached thousands of residents for the first time in over a month. The area is one of the last remaining pockets of opposition to regime leader Assad and depends on aid and smuggling. Rebels have responded to the shelling with a barrage of mortars lobbed at regime-held districts in Damascus wounding at least 10 civilians in three neighbourhoods. The rebels and the regime are meanwhile set to conclude the latest round of talks in the Kazakh capital Astana. The negotiations are sponsored by Turkey which backs the rebels as well as Russia and Iran. The de-escalation zones agreed to in Astana have significantly reduced the violence in many parts of Syria but a lasting political solution remains elusive.

Tags Suicide bomb Syria Damascus Islamic State rebels police station A double suicide bomb attack hit a police station in Syrias capital Damascus on Monday state media said with a monitor saying at least 17 people were killed. The Syrian interior ministry said on Monday that the attack involved two suicide bombers one of whom managed to penetrate the police station in the southern district of Midan and reach the first floor before his explosives detonated. A monitor reported a third explosion involved a car bomb outside the police station. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitoring group said at least 17 people were killed in the attack among them 13 police officers. Interior Minister Mohammed Shaar told reporters that one of the attackers had managed to enter the police station and reach the first floor of the building. State television showed images of damage from inside the building with a black police uniform shirt covered in dust lying in the rubble of partially collapsed walls. Manal a 28-year-old teacher living in Midan said she heard at least two blasts on Monday afternoon. \"I was coming back from work when I heard the sound of an explosion it was around 230 pm I didnt know what it was and then there was another explosion a few minutes later and buildings shook\" she told AFP. \"Afterwards I heard gunfire which usually happens to get people to move out of the way and clear the road so ambulances can get through to retrieve the injured\" she added. IS claims attack The Islamic State [IS] group on Tuesday claimed the attack in a statement circulated on its social media accounts. The group said three of its fighters armed with guns grenades and explosives were involved in the attack in the southern neighbourhood of Midan on Monday. Damascus has also been rocked by occasional bomb blasts throughout the Syrian conflict including previous attacks on Midan a middle-class residential and shopping district. In December 2016 three police officers were wounded when a seven-year-old girl walked into the neighbourhoods police station wearing an explosive belt that was remotely detonated. Rebel groups have been gradually expelled from territory in the capital they once held though they maintain a presence in a handful of positions including the Jobar neighbourhood. They also hold territory in the Eastern Ghouta region outside the capital and have regularly launched rockets into the city. The Syrian conflict began when the Baath regime in power since 1963 and led by President Bashar al-Assad responded with military force to peaceful protests demanding democratic reforms during the Arab Spring wave of uprisings triggering an armed rebellion fuelled by mass defections from the Syrian army. According to independent monitors hundreds of thousands of civilians have been killed in the war mostly by the regime and its powerful allies and millions have been displaced both inside and outside of Syria. The brutal tactics pursued mainly by the regime which have included the use of chemical weapons sieges mass executions and torture against civilians have led to war crimes investigations.

The highest toll was in Douma the largest town in the Eastern Ghouta region where raids killed 16 civilians including at least one child and wounded 22 it said. A witness at the town hospital said he saw many wounded people their faces bloodied. All the facilitys beds were occupied by men women and children. Five more civilians were killed in the town of Sabqa and one in the town of Harasta both also in Eastern Ghouta the Observatory said. Devastating regime siege The Eastern Ghouta region is adjacent to the capitals eastern neighbourhood of Jobar which is divided between regime and rebel control. Last month the armed opposition launched a surprise assault against regime forces from Jobar but was repelled after a week of fighting. Eastern Ghouta has been under a devastating regime siege since 2012 and is targeted regularly by air strikes and artillery. It is the last remaining opposition stronghold near Damascus where a string of local \"reconciliation deals\" have seen villages and towns brought back under the control of regime leader Bashar Al Assad. The regime is fighting to push rebels out of five neighbourhoods in Damascus. The rebels control almost all of Qabun and Tishreen in the northeast as well as half of Jobar in the east. They are also present in Barzeh in the north and Tadamun in the south but the neighbourhoods are covered by a truce with the regime.

Tags Syria Damascus Eastern Ghouta Assad UN SOHR Intense Syrian regime bombardment on rebel-held Eastern Ghouta region has killed eight civilians and wounded 25. Six days of heavy bombing have killed dozens in the region where rebel groups and regime forces are locked in a cycle of tit-for-tat attacks. Government forces have escalated their bombardment of Eastern Ghouta an opposition stronghold outside Damascus since hardline rebel group Ahrar al-Sham attacked a military base in the area last week. Since Tuesday heavy artillery fire and air strikes on Eastern Ghouta have killed at least 66 civilians including 13 children according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights as well as three rescue workers from the Syrian Civil Defence - better known as the White Helmets. At least 281 people have been wounded the Britain-based monitor said on Sunday. Rebel groups meanwhile have fired rockets into Damascus neighbourhoods killing at least 16 people since Thursday the Observatory said. The toll included two people killed by rocket fire on Sunday. Eastern Ghouta is supposed to be part of a \"de-escalation zone\" under a deal between Russia Iran and Turkey aimed at reducing the level of violence. President Bashar al-Assads forces have besieged Eastern Ghouta since 2013 making humanitarian conditions in the area where some 400000 people live extremely dire. On Sunday the UNs coordinator for humanitarian and development affairs in Syria Ali al-Zaatari called on \"all warring sides to avoid targeting civilians\". \"For days there have been daily reports about civilians being killed and others being severely wounded in addition to warehouses hospitals and schools being put out of service during the exchange of shellfire particularly in Damascus and Eastern Ghouta\" Zaatari said. The Syrian conflict began when the Baath regime in power since 1963 and led by Assad responded with military force to peaceful protests demanding democratic reforms during the Arab Spring wave of uprisings triggering an armed rebellion fueled by mass defections from the Syrian army. The brutal tactics pursued mainly by the regime which have included the use of chemical weapons sieges mass executions and torture against civilians have led to war crimes investigations.

       "{'messages': [AIMessage(content='Label: 1\\nConfidence: 0.9\\nExplanation:\\nThe article provides credible evidence that the symptoms observed in the victims of the suspected chemical attack in Syria are consistent with exposure to a nerve agent, likely sarin. The key points that support this assessment are:\\n\\n1. The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that \"some cases appear to show additional signs consistent with exposure to organophosphorus chemicals, a category of chemicals that includes nerve agents.\" This indicates that the WHO\\'s medical experts have assessed the symptoms and determined they are characteristic of nerve agent exposure.\\n\\n2. The article notes that sarin is an organophosphorus compound and a nerve agent, while other chemicals like chlorine and mustard gas are not. This further supports the assessment that the symptoms point to a nerve agent being used, rather than other types of chemical weapons.\\n\\n3. The article cites the U.S. government\\'s assessment that the deaths were caused by sarin nerve gas dropped by Syrian aircraft. While Russia has provided an alternative explanation, the WHO\\'s medical evaluation lends more credibility to the U.S. assessment.\\n\\n4.

       " 'article_content': 'Wed 05 Apr 2017 Syria attack symptoms consistent with nerve agent use WHO. Victims of a suspected chemical attack in Syria appeared to show symptoms consistent with reaction to a nerve agent the World Health Organization said on Wednesday. \"Some cases appear to show additional signs consistent with exposure to organophosphorus chemicals a category of chemicals that includes nerve agents\" WHO said in a statement putting the death toll at at least 70. The United States has said the deaths were caused by sarin nerve gas dropped by Syrian aircraft. Russia has said it believes poison gas had leaked from a rebel chemical weapons depot struck by Syrian bombs. Sarin is an organophosporus compound and a nerve agent. Chlorine and mustard gas which are also believed to have been used in the past in Syria are not. A Russian Defence Ministry spokesman did not say what agent was used in the attack but said the rebels had used the same chemical weapons in Aleppo last year. The WHO said it was likely that some kind of chemical was used in the attack because sufferers had no apparent external injuries and died from a rapid onset of similar symptoms including acute respiratory distress. It said its experts in Turkey were giving guidance to overwhelmed health workers in Idlib on the diagnosis and treatment of patients and medicines such as Atropine an antidote for some types of chemical exposure and steroids for symptomatic treatment had been sent. A U.N. Commission of Inquiry into human rights in Syria has previously said forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have used lethal chlorine gas on multiple occasions. Hundreds of civilians died in a sarin gas attack in Ghouta on the outskirts of Damascus in August 2013. Assads government has always denied responsibility for that attack. Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Moscow and Washington. But Russia a Syrian ally and China have repeatedly vetoed any United Nations move to sanction Assad or refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. \"These types of weapons are banned by international law because they represent an intolerable barbarism\" Peter Salama Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme said in the WHO statement. - REUTERS',\n",

       " 'explanation': 'The article provides credible evidence that the symptoms observed in the victims of the suspected chemical attack in Syria are consistent with exposure to a nerve agent, likely sarin. The key points that support this assessment are:\\n\\n1. The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that \"some cases appear to show additional signs consistent with exposure to organophosphorus chemicals, a category of chemicals that includes nerve agents.\" This indicates that the WHO\\'s medical experts have assessed the symptoms and determined they are characteristic of nerve agent exposure.\\n\\n2. The article notes that sarin is an organophosphorus compound and a nerve agent, while other chemicals like chlorine and mustard gas are not. This further supports the assessment that the symptoms point to a nerve agent being used, rather than other types of chemical weapons.\\n\\n3. The article cites the U.S. government\\'s assessment that the deaths were caused by sarin nerve gas dropped by Syrian aircraft. While Russia has provided an alternative explanation, the WHO\\'s medical evaluation lends more credibility to the U.S. assessment.\\n\\n4. The article also references previous instances where the U.N. Commission of Inquiry has determined that forces loyal to the Syrian government have used lethal chlorine gas. This provides additional context on the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian conflict.\\n\\nOverall, the detailed medical assessment from the WHO, combined with the corroborating information from other sources, provides a strong basis to conclude that the symptoms are consistent with nerve agent use, likely sarin. The confidence level is high, at 0.9, given the authoritative nature of the WHO\\'s evaluation'}"
