Article: As the coronavirus pandemic continues to worsen in the US, NASA is still moving forward with many of its upcoming missions, including some launches that will send humans to the International Space Station in the near future. As of now, NASA does not foresee any changes being made to these missions, and there are already procedures in place to guarantee astronauts do not bring any illnesses with them into space.  NASA has its own internal ‚Äúresponse framework‚Äù for how it plans to deal with the pandemic. It lists four different stages for the agency, which each detail the amount of people who will work from home, the level of access to NASA facilities, and how much travel will be allowed. Right now, two NASA centers ‚Äî Ames Research Center and Marshall Space Flight Center ‚Äî are on Stage 3, which makes telework mandatory and only allows ‚Äúmission-essential‚Äù personnel on site at facilities. NASA bumped these two centers to Stage 3 after employees tested positive for COVID-19 at each place.  NASA has its own internal ‚Äúresponse framework‚Äù for how to deal with the pandemic  NASA‚Äôs Johnson Space Center, which oversees the agency‚Äôs human spaceflight launches and operates the International Space Station, is only at Stage 2. At that level, teleworking is strongly encouraged, though not mandatory, while various facilities are closed down. ‚ÄúThe health and safety of NASA‚Äôs workforce is the agency‚Äôs top priority. As the coronavirus (COVID-19) concern continues to escalate, NASA is taking steps to ensure its workforce is protected and informed,‚Äù a NASA spokesperson at JSC said in a statement.  But as more workers at JSC stay home, they‚Äôre still looking ahead to the next launch of people to the ISS, which is slated for April 9th out of Kazakhstan. A Russian Soyuz rocket will launch three crew members, including NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy, to the station, where they‚Äôll join three people already in orbit.  That launch is still on, and NASA says the agency hasn‚Äôt made any changes to operations and schedule surrounding the mission. As of yesterday, Kazakhstan effectively closed its borders after reporting its first coronavirus cases in the country. No one can enter the country except for diplomats, returning citizens, and those invited by the country‚Äôs government, according to Reuters. NASA is still assessing if changes are needed regarding how personnel will travel to Kazakhstan.  Of course, the concern is that the astronauts flying to the station could carry the coronavirus with them, if they don‚Äôt know that they‚Äôre infected with the virus. But NASA already has a long-held strategy in place for preventing astronauts from carrying any nasty bugs with them to space. All astronauts going to orbit must go through a two-week period of quarantine called ‚Äúhealth stabilization,‚Äù according to NASA. That way, the agency can make sure the crew is not incubating any illnesses before launch. However, NASA said it ‚Äúwill continue to evaluate and augment this plan, in coordination with its international and commercial partners‚Äù if needed.  In the meantime, Russia‚Äôs state space corporation, Roscosmos, has decided to shut down all media activity surrounding the Soyuz launch, barring journalists from covering the mission in person. Russia will still live stream the launch, and NASA typically airs all of its crewed launches on its own online TV channel.  All astronauts going to orbit must go through a two-week period of quarantine  Once this launch is over, the next big milestone for JSC is the return of crew from the ISS. NASA astronauts Andrew Morgan, Jessica Meir, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka are slated to return to Earth in a Soyuz capsule in mid-April, landing in the Kazakhstan desert. Such landings typically require large groups of recovery personnel to extract the astronauts from the landed capsule. NASA did not provide any details if those operations would change in light of the pandemic.  However, NASA has more than one upcoming crewed mission on its calendar. Soon, NASA‚Äôs commercial partner SpaceX will be ready to send its first crew of NASA astronauts to the International Space Station. The launch is a critical one for NASA‚Äôs Commercial Crew Program, an initiative to develop privately funded vehicles to transport people to and from the ISS. SpaceX has been developing its Crew Dragon capsule for the program, and the first vehicle that will fly a crew of two to the station is already in Florida ahead of its inaugural flight.  SpaceX is currently targeting May for that flight, according to the company‚Äôs president Gwynne Shotwell. NASA also says that SpaceX‚Äôs passengers for the mission, astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, are continuing to train for the mission as originally planned. As for operations at SpaceX, it seems like things are still moving ahead as usual. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk sent an email last week to the company‚Äôs employees underplaying the coronavirus threat, arguing people were more likely to die in a car crash than from the virus.  Of course, the situations at NASA and SpaceX are subject to change quickly. The coronavirus pandemic is ever-evolving, with cities, states, and countries making swift changes every few hours to combat the spread of the disease. And already, launches are being affected. Europe‚Äôs primary spaceport in French Guiana, South America is suspending all launches from the site for the foreseeable future, in order to protect the health of employees and people in the area.  It‚Äôs possible that upcoming launches from the US could be postponed as well. It just depends on how companies plan to react and if governments take even more decisive action.

DePaul University and Loyola University of Chicago have consulted with public health experts and state and local officials to devise their plans for the fall semester.  DePaul expects to have limited in-person learning and reduced occupancy in the dorms this fall. Meanwhile, Loyola hopes to offer both on-campus and online classes.  Both universities said they‚Äôll share more details about the fall semester in the coming weeks.  Loyola also announced its ‚ÄúLoyola Commitment,‚Äù a new financial aid program, funded by the university and its donors, which will help students who have been affected by the economic downturn amid the pandemic.  ‚ÄúAs unemployment rises along with uncertainty about our economic outlook, we will see a sharp increase in students and families whose plans about attending Loyola might be hindered. Dreams are being crushed by diminished family finances,‚Äù Loyola provost Norberto Grzywacz wrote in an email to students. ‚ÄúThe scale of this crisis and its financial impact on families will have a profound effect on many students from various backgrounds.

In a show of gratitude to a local bridal shop, Novias Davila in Little Village, Jimenez donated official Sox uniforms and funds to the shop, which is making face masks needed for the community during the coronavirus pandemic.  Shop owner Tania Hern√°ndez received a video message from Jim√©nez on Friday, thanking her team for their commitment to the community. Jimenez gave each of seven workers a $500 Jewel-Osco gift card and $500 in cash to provide support during this time.

It‚Äôs unclear when Chicago‚Äôs 81 libraries will reopen, but staff are returning to their jobs Wednesday to prepare for the day when doors will be flung open and patrons will be welcomed back.  ‚ÄúAbsolutely no date has been set to open libraries to the public, and any reopening decision would be consistent with public health guidance and dependent on where our data is at that time,‚Äù Jordan Troy, a spokesman for Mayor Lightfoot, said in an email Friday.  ‚ÄúAs the mayor has stated since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, every decision made in city government will be guided by science and data.‚Äù  Libraries have been closed since March 21.

With the latest 130 deaths, the state has lost 1,727 people so far in May, and 4,058 overall.  There were also 2,432 more people testing positive among the latest batch of 26,565 test results, officials said. And Edgar County became the 100th county to record positive cases in the state.  There have been 90,369 confirmed coronavirus cases since the pandemic began.  The state‚Äôs overall positivity rate ‚Äî the number of positive cases compared to total tests received ‚Äî was 9.1%. And the Northeast region, home to Chicago, Cook and the collar counties, remained under 20%, a benchmark set for further to enter the next phase of Gov. J.B. Pritzker‚Äôs regional reopening plan.  Read the full report from Tina Sfondeles here.  2:36 p.m. Cook County surpasses Queens, NY, as county with most COVID-19 cases in U.S.  Cook County has surpassed Queens County in New York as the U.S. county with the most coronavirus cases based on Sun-Times analysis of the latest public data.  There have been 58,457 total cases of COVID-19 recorded in Cook County, which includes all of Chicago and many of its suburbs, after officials added 2,051 new cases in the last 24 hours. Queens, by comparison, added only 336 cases over the same time frame to bring its total to 58,084.  Cook County still has a lower rate of COVID-19 per capita given its population (5.1 million) is more than twice as large as Queens (2.25 million). But Queens also has a much higher population density with 20,500 people per square mile compared to 5,500 per square mile in Cook County, which can make social distancing measures more challenging to maintain.  1:55 p.m. Lightfoot hints at street closures to help restaurants  Is Mayor Lori Lightfoot planning to close streets and sidewalks so restaurants can safely reopen and give residents a place to run, walk and play? Sure sounds like it.  ‚ÄúPeople are itching to get outside. Businesses are looking at creative ways to serve customers. The key is how we do it,‚Äù the mayor tweeted Friday.  ‚ÄúStay tuned for some changes to our streets and sidewalks. Transportation is more than just cars. We‚Äôll show how Chicago can be safer and easier to get around.‚Äù  Last week, Illinois Restaurant Association President Sam Toia urged Gov. J.B. Pritzker to relax his five-step plan to reopen Illinois by allowing restaurants to open at 25% of capacity beginning June 1 with strict safeguards for restaurant employees, including face masks and daily temperature checks.  At the time, Toia teased the street closing idea.

J.B. Pritzker‚Äôs stay-at-home order ‚Äî and warned she is prepared to ‚Äúenforce the rules‚Äù if they don‚Äôt.  In a ‚ÄúDear Members of the Chicago Faith Community‚Äù letter sent Thursday, Lightfoot urged religious leaders to continue holding virtual services rather than in-person services, where it is difficult, if not impossible, to maintain social distance.  ‚ÄúI am urging you to stay the course. If there is a problem, I would rather be in conversation than in conflict. But to be clear, I am resolute that I must enforce the rules of the governor‚Äôs stay-at-home order. To be fair to all, I simply cannot look away from non-compliance, no matter the source or the intention,‚Äù she wrote.  On Monday, Lightfoot responded to Sunday service defiance by saying she hoped to educate religious leaders into compliance, avoiding mass arrests.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not gonna send in the police to arrest parishioners. People are exercising their faith, and I understand that,‚Äù she said then.  But the next day, the mayor made it clear she was serious about enforcing the governor‚Äôs order and she would do what she must.

According to a story published by The Athletic, Ricketts said the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, conflicts over the best time to reopen businesses, and continuing negotiations between the owners and players could combine to prevent the start of the season.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anyone can answer that question just yet,‚Äù Ricketts said during a virtual forum with season-ticket holders Thursday. ‚ÄúThe current thinking and the current discussions (among owners) have been all around trying to get back into our home ballparks for this season. Obviously, without fans. Now that creates three specific problems that we have to address.‚Äù  The team has been consulting with health professionals on the best way to make Wrigley Field safe, according to a recording of Cubs president Crane Kenney obtained by The Athletic.  ‚Äî Sun-Times Staff  12:26 p.m. The high cost of quarantine  In a letter to the Sun-Times editors, Tom Gregg of Niles writes:  Before the quarantine, I was visiting my 99-year-old mother twice a day in our retirement home, and she was holding her own in terms of her health. She is vision-impaired, hearing-impaired, arthritic and suffering from mild dementia, certainly, but for 13 years in two homes she had largely been able to avoid hospital stays for life-threatening problems. Plus, her interaction with me seemed to greatly help in minimizing her spells of confusion.  But now, during our relatively brief period of enforced separation ‚Äî I live on a lower floor while she lives up on an assisted living floor ‚Äî she has contracted pneumonia, for which she has been in and out of hospital, and her spells of confusion seem to be worsening. Symptomatic, doubtless, of the unprecedented disorientation.  My mother remains among the living today, but for how long if she remains so isolated? Now multiply this single case by all the other seniors around the country who have seen their precious interactive routines disappear. It is a situation that many of them, given their cognitive limitations, have difficulty grasping.  This potentially lethal hardship is worth noting when we are formulating pandemic recovery plans. The cure of the quarantine shouldn‚Äôt cost more than the contagion itself, should it?  Read this and more letters here.  11:44 a.m. What‚Äôs the first meal you‚Äôll want at a restaurant post-pandemic? We asked, Chicagoans answered.  With eat-in dining at restaurants on hold because of the state‚Äôs coronavirus stay-at-home order, the next time you‚Äôll be waited on at a restaurant probably won‚Äôt be for a while.  Gov. J.B. Pritzker‚Äôs five-phase plan for reopening Illinois businesses puts restaurant reopenings in Phase 4. We‚Äôre now in Phase 2.  So with Chicagoans craving a meal out, we asked: Once restaurants reopen for dining in, what‚Äôs the first meal you‚Äôll want to eat out, and from where? Some of these answers have been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  ‚ÄúBreakfast at a Greek joint: feta cheese-and-spinach omelet, hashbrowns and an English muffin or pancakes.‚Äù ‚Äî Rose Panieri  ‚ÄúA hamburger from Charlie Beinlich‚Äôs in Glencoe.‚Äù ‚Äî Elena Zaremski  ‚ÄúTango Sur ‚Äî the filet with spinach mashed potatoes.‚Äù ‚Äî Marcela Guzman  Read more answers from our readers here.  10:08 a.m. How we should honor our youngest COVID-19 victim  Ernesto Guzman, age 12, suffered from asthma and obstructive sleep apnea, two other underlying health problems with potentially serious consequences that have figured into many other COVID-19 deaths, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner‚Äôs office.  But make no mistake, doctors say it was the coronavirus that caused the pneumonia that took Ernesto‚Äôs life early Thursday morning at Advocate Christ Medical Center, Oak Lawn.  Because his death occurred after midnight, it is not yet counted among the 3,928 official COVID-19 deaths in Illinois, but it was listed among the single-day record high of 126 deaths reported Thursday from Cook County by the medical examiner.  Will the death of a 12-year-old boy cause more people to take this disease seriously? Mark Brown says he doubts it. But he hopes that will change.  ‚ÄúTake this seriously, folks,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúTake it very seriously, because the life you risk may not be your own.‚Äù  Read Mark Brown‚Äôs full column here.  8:49 a.m. Abbott rapid COVID-19 test may yield false negatives, FDA warns  The federal Food and Drug Administration issued a warning Thursday night that early data suggests Abbott Laboratories‚Äô rapid coronavirus test, touted by the Trump administration as a game changer, may return inaccurate and false negative results ‚Äî findings the Chicago-area firm vehemently denied.  The Abbott ID NOW test ‚Äî which can provide results in minutes ‚Äî is used by the White House to quickly test anyone who comes into proximity of President Donald Trump. Trump has lavished attention on the Abbott ID NOW test and featured it at a White House event three days after the FDA fast-tracked its approval by granting an emergency use authorization on March 27.  In just a few weeks time, Abbott has shipped 1.8 million of the ID NOW tests, which is used at several Chicago-area testing sites.  The FDA warning came a day after a New York University preliminary study raised questions about its accuracy. The study was not subject to peer review, a process that checks on the procedures used for a study as well as its findings.

SPRINGFIELD ‚Äî After weeks of nudges from Republican legislators, the General Assembly is planning to return to Springfield to get back to work.  And as they prepare for the Legislature‚Äôs long-sought session next week, Republicans said Thursday they are willing to comply with safety guidelines issued by the Democrats ‚Äì but they want an examination of their own.  GOP lawmakers said they will wear face coverings, submit to COVID-19 tests and temperature checks and follow other safety measures when they return to Springfield, but they balked at signing a pledge to follow those recommendations as requested by House Speaker Mike Madigan.  And Republicans want to put Gov. J.B. Pritzker‚Äôs ‚ÄúRestore Illinois‚Äù plan under the microscope with a public hearing.  GOP lawmakers have criticized Pritzker‚Äôs ‚ÄúRestore Illinois‚Äù plan as ‚Äúarbitrary,‚Äù saying the dates in which parts of the states can begin to reopen don‚Äôt make sense, and its metrics ignore geographical differences in COVID-19‚Äôs impact.  Read the full story by Neal Earley here.  6:45 a.m. With the focus on the coronavirus, Lightfoot opts for bare-bones capital plan  Singularly focused on the war against the coronavirus, Mayor Lori Lightfoot has opted for a $100 million, bare bones capital plan ‚Äî bankrolled by an existing line of credit ‚Äî to pay for new vehicles, sidewalks and the treasured aldermanic menu program.  Normally, the city issues general obligation bonds backed by property taxes to cover a more sweeping capital program. But these are not normal times.  The Lightfoot administration is preoccupied with the city‚Äôs response to the coronavirus and the budget crisis triggered by the stay-at-home shutdown of the Chicago economy.  So the decision was made to proceed only with those capital projects and purchases that absolutely needed to get done and to finance it with a line of credit that remained, even after Lightfoot saved $22 million by eliminating a $1.4 billion line of credit negotiated by former Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

New cases  Analysis & Commentary  7:47 p.m. Everything must be on the table as city, state fight back from financial devastation  Washington to cities and states: You‚Äôre on your own.  For months, the Trump administration has failed to take the lead in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, punting responsibility to the states. Now the president and his Republican Party are looking to do the same when it comes to helping states and cities survive the pandemic‚Äôs financial devastation.  A $3 trillion stimulus package expected to be approved by the Democratic-controlled House looks dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate, and President Donald Trump is making clear he would never sign such a bill.  Why? Because the package to rescue drowning cities, suburbs, states, small businesses and unemployed Americans would be fiscally imprudent, they claim.  We couldn‚Äôt disagree more. And, yes, this is the same Senate and president who rewrote the federal tax code in 2017 to give billions of dollars in tax cuts to the wealthiest one percent of Americans, ballooning the federal deficit.  So what does all this mean for Illinois and Chicago, as well as for towns and counties statewide?  Read the full editorial from the CST Editorial Board here.  6:35 p.m. Gov. Pritzker fumbles rollout of ‚ÄòRestore Illinois‚Äô  For many weeks after the beginning of this COVID-19 crisis, Gov. J.B. Pritzker proved adept at telegraphing his every move.  Pritzker waited until people practically begged him to shut down the schools on March 15. He talked about issuing a stay-at-home order for days, and then acted on March 21 only after California jumped first.  It was clear for days that he would extend his stay-at-home order another month starting April 1. He talked for well over a week about a mask-wearing requirement, always noting that he was being lobbied by Republican state Rep. Mark Batinick before finally announcing the order on April 23.  People did not always agreed with him, but they always had a sense of where he was going. Pritzker did get out over his skis when his Illinois Workers‚Äô Compensation Commission dramatically altered the burden of proof on COVID-19 illnesses in favor of employees without so much as a heads-up to business groups. But most regular folks never noticed that and a court intervened and stopped the order anyway.  Otherwise, the governor did a remarkably good job of making sure the public was always aware in advance of his leadership direction.  And then on May 5 he announced his ‚ÄúRestore Illinois‚Äù roadmap to gradually reopen the state.

Maybe it‚Äôs best we just leave the flag as it is, even if the city manages to prevail against COVID-19.  Last Friday and again on Wednesday, Mayor Lori Lightfoot floated the idea of adding a fifth red star to Chicago‚Äôs flag to mark the city‚Äôs response to the coronavirus pandemic. She was trying to rally the city. If Chicago‚Äôs effort to beat the virus is terrifically successful, she said Friday, it will ‚Äútruly warrant a fifth star on our flag.‚Äù  But let‚Äôs be blunt. Chicago‚Äôs not about to be terrifically successful anytime soon. Nobody is. This is a global public health war that‚Äôs sure to be fought for years, and a lot of people are setting us up to lose.

Navy Pier Inc., which leases the 104-year-old pier from the public, is a government body that masquerades as a nonprofit organization. As such, it has been allowed to hide its workings from public scrutiny while benefiting from public support.  Navy Pier Inc. pays just $1 a year to the state and city to lease the pier.  And just this week, Sun-Times reporters Tim Novak and Robert Herguth revealed that the organization, whose president is paid more than $540,000 a year, has received a nearly $2.5 million coronavirus stimulus loan from the federal government‚Äôs Paycheck Protection Program.  Like all nonprofits, Navy Pier Inc. must disclose much of its finances by filing 990 forms, but it does not have to comply with Freedom of Information Act requests or disclose the terms of contracts.

Article: If you were given this bed when you went to the hospital, would that make you concerned?  Not gonna lie, I‚Äôd be a little worried.  During this pandemic, some people have taken the opportunity to create some new products to help with the fight against the virus that has caused global lockdowns and over 300,000 deaths worldwide.  Online platforms like Zoom and GoToMeeting have adjusted their platforms for high-demand use so that more people can work remotely and have kids continue the school year with online classes. We‚Äôve discovered that while it‚Äôs clearly not for everyone, it‚Äôs not so bad.

Now, I‚Äôm not against a sign company looking to meet a need in the community and repurpose their facility for that.  BUT‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs just so much wrong with this.  First, having a hospital bed that converts into a coffin is just ghoulish. We don‚Äôt send people to the hospital expecting them to die. There is no hope left when someone is put in a bed that could instantly be converted into their coffin.  Second, it‚Äôs made of cardboard. That‚Äôs dehumanizing. This isn‚Äôt a small pet that you bury in the backyard in a shoebox, these are human beings not Speedy the Wonder Hamster that your third-grader is crying over.  Remind me, what happens when cardboard gets wet? Because that could be a problem. You clearly can‚Äôt clean someone on this thing, and what about feeding? What happens if someone spills water on it? The biggest problem that I see is that the body itself contains fluids like blood, saliva, sputum, urine, and other things, all of which can spread disease. Even if this thing was treated to be ‚Äúwaterproof‚Äù you‚Äôd have to toss it the minute bodily fluids touched it and in a hospital setting that would be in pretty short order.  This is a clear case of ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt think that one through‚Äù and ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt consult with a single medical professional.‚Äù  But you know that morons in government are going to see this as a brilliant and much-needed innovation in the midst of a pandemic.  Speaking of morons in government‚Ä¶  These bed/coffin combo units might be Governor Cuomo‚Äôs new state-mandated nursing home beds‚Äìbecause that completely fits with his policies. Maybe he‚Äôll add in blankets that can double as a body-bag since he‚Äôs already sending body bags to nursing homes.  [Quick Update from the author: I think I‚Äôm being unfair to Governor Cuomo who has rescinded his disastrous policy that forces nursing homes to take COVID-positive patients now that thousands of people senselessly died. I should also include the other governors who sent COVID-positive patients into nursing homes but have not rescinded the order like New Jersey‚Äôs Phil Murphy and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, as well as those simply covering up the data like California‚Äôs Gavin Newsom.]  Note to the creators of this horrific hospital bed/coffin hybrid‚Ä¶  Just because you can do something, doesn‚Äôt mean that you should do it.

Article: (Natural News) Over 4,300 recovering COVID-19 patients were shipped off to New York√¢¬Ä¬ôs nursing homes and long-term care facilities as a result of a controversial state directive, according to The Associated Press.  In a count published on its site Friday, the news organization tallied the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from hospitals and transferred to nursing homes under Gov. Andrew Cuomo√¢¬Ä¬ôs March 25 directive after the New York State Health Department declined to release the figures gleaned from its internal survey, conducted two weeks ago.  The health department is still verifying √¢¬Ä¬úincomplete√¢¬Ä¬ù data.  According to critics, the directive, which had been intended to help free up hospital beds for the sickest patients as cases surged, instead only helped speed up the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus in the mentioned establishments, in addition to placing an additional burden on already overwhelmed facilities.  √¢¬Ä¬úA number of nursing homes have felt constrained by the order and admitted hospital discharged patients without knowing what their COVID status was,√¢¬Ä¬ù said Chris Laxton, executive director of the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.  According to numbers posted by New York√¢¬Ä¬ôs Department of Health, the state‚Äôs nursing home COVID-19 death toll stood well over 5,000 as of this writing, making it a significant chunk of the state√¢¬Ä¬ôs total running death toll from the virus.  The directive, which also noted that the state√¢¬Ä¬ôs nursing homes and related facilities cannot refuse patients, was reversed on May 10.  Following intense criticism, Cuomo, in his subsequent media briefings, said he was merely following recommendations set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  No matter how much Cuomo spins the said directive however, Stuart Almer, a nursing home operator, said it cannot be denied that the state order still put staff and residents at great risk.  √¢¬Ä¬úWe can√¢¬Ä¬ôt draw a straight line from bringing in someone positive to someone catching the disease, but we√¢¬Ä¬ôre talking about elderly, fragile and vulnerable residents,√¢¬Ä¬ù Almer stated in an interview with AP. (Related: New York nursing homes now a √¢¬Ä¬úslaughterhouse√¢¬Ä¬ù for elderly coronavirus patients.)  According to Almer, his staff at Gurwin Jewish, a 460-bed nursing home on Long Island, had to scramble in order to accommodate what he called a √¢¬Ä¬úflood√¢¬Ä¬ù of 58 recovering COVID-19 patients from local hospitals.  Almer stressed that while they did what they could to ensure the safety of their residents, such as by erecting more walls and by implementing other safety measures, residents at Gurwin nonetheless started falling sick, 47 of which died of confirmed or suspected COVID-19.  The families of those who died are furious.  ‚ÄúIt was the single dumbest decision anyone could make if they wanted to kill people,‚Äù Daniel Arbeeny told the AP in an interview.  According to Arbeeny, his 88-year-old father succumbed to the virus after being pulled out of a Brooklyn nursing home that saw more than 50 deaths.  ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt rocket science. We knew the most vulnerable were in nursing homes and rehab centers,‚Äù Arbeeny said, citing studies that pointed to the elderly and immunocompromised as being the most likely to succumb to the virus.  Former New York lieutenant governor and Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths founder Betsy McCaughey did not mince words when speaking about the current situation in the state√¢¬Ä¬ôs nursing homes.  √¢¬Ä¬úThey√¢¬Ä¬ôre death pits,√¢¬Ä¬ù McCaughey told The New York Times.  √¢¬Ä¬úThese nursing homes are already overwhelmed. They√¢¬Ä¬ôre crowded and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre understaffed. One COVID-positive patient in a nursing home produces carnage,√¢¬Ä¬ù she added.  As of press time, the state of New York has recorded a running total of 358,000 infections and 23,195 deaths from the coronavirus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
