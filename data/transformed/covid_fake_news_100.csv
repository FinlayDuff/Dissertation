Interesting Psak: Shul and the Corona Virus,"Feb 5, 2020 Interesting Psak: Shul and the Corona Virus This is a bit too brief for my liking, but Actualic bring an interesting psak about going to shul during this scare of the Corona Virus. According to the report, some Jews from China sent a question to a special beis din in Bnei Braq established to deal with medical issues and halacha headed by Rav Shmuel Eliezer Stern. These Jews in China are concerned about the spread of this dangerous Corona Virus and want to know if they should continue to go to shul to daven with a minyan or if they should avoid it out of fear of getting infected with the virus? The answer from the beis din was that we have to be more stringent regarding situations of danger than regarding situations of transgressing prohibitions. Ergo, if there is even a slight concern about the virus spreading and getting infected by going to shul,. one should not go to the shul. I guess this means it is not a blanket hetter to stay home, but if in the location where any specific person is there is a valid concern of the virus, one should stay home. If where you are there has been no virus and there is no real concern, then go to shul. Rav Chaim Kanievsky, and other rabbonim, have been asked similar questions and have answered similarly, adding that the professional authorities dealing with the issues should be listened to and instructions followed to avoid getting exposed to the virus. Everyone should stay healthy!",0

Cure for corona virus disease,"According to an old source, ribavirin and interferon alpha-2b have been found as potential treatment for a strain of corona virus. An article in webmd told us: (1) ""A treatment for a new coronavirus that has caused 11 deaths, mostly in the Middle East, shows promise in early tests, U.S. government researchers report. The investigators discovered that a combination of two antiviral drugs -- ribavirin and interferon-alpha 2b -- can stop the so-called nCoV coronavirus from multiplying in laboratory-grown cells. While the results suggest that this drug combination could be used to treat patients infected with nCoV, more research is needed to confirm these early findings. Both drugs are approved in the United States for treating people with hepatitis C. The nCoV coronavirus was first identified in Saudi Arabia in September 2012. As of April 16, 2013, there had been 17 reported cases, including 11 deaths. Most cases have occurred in the Middle East."" But such a finding was only in early investigation phase. We don't know yet what is the latest update of such a new potential treatment. Nonetheless, a fast response to nCoV epidemics spreading by medical institutions is urgently in need.",0
Bharatpur Hospital sets up isolation ward for corona virus patients,"Kathmandu, 1 February : Bharatpur Hospital has maintained high alert after the epidemic of corona virus spread from neighbouring country China. For the patients suspected of corona virus, it has set up an isolation ward.

At the initial phase isolation ward has five beds.",0
TOP CDC OFFICIAL: ‘WE’LL JUST GET RID OF ALL WHITES IN THE UNITED STATES’ WHO REFUSE VACCINES,"A top Center for Disease Control official was caught on tape in 2016 saying that society should “get rid of of all the whites in the United States” to reduce the number of people who refuse vaccines.  Dr. Carol Baker made the alarming remarks during the “Achieving Childhood Vaccine Success in the U.S.” panel discussion sponsored by the National Meningitis Association in New York City on May 9, 2016.  “So I have the solution. Every study published in the last five years, when you look at vaccine refusers,” Baker told the panel. “I’m not talking about…hesitance, most of them we can talk into coming to terms. But refusers. We’ll just get rid of all the whites in the United States…Guess who wants to get vaccinated the most? Immigrants.” Notably, Baker was appointed Chair of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization by Obama’s Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius in 2009.  The Houston doctor was also honored with the Sabin Vaccine Institute’s 2019 Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal at a Washington D.C. ceremony sponsored “in part by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Pfizer.”  Is is really that surprising a Bill Gates-connected CDC official openly suggested depopulating whites who don’t cooperate with their mandatory vaccine agenda?",0
`People's War' on the Corona Virus - Bill Bishop ,"Crash project to build a 1,000 bed hospital in Wuhan ""People's War"" on the virus; Expanding quarantine efforts by Bill Bishop The People’s Daily said in a front page commentary Tuesday that the country is in a “People’s War” with the virus. So far the virus continues its advance, per the latest official figures from Caixin : 20,522 confirmed cases in China; 426 deaths in China; 23,214 suspected cases in China Do not be surprised to see a jump over the next few days in Wuhan and Hubei cases as the number of hospital beds and quarantine facilities increase, more medical personnel arrive from other provinces and testing capacity improves. The propaganda organs are all emphasizing Xi’s leading role in responding to the outbreak, but there have been no new images of him in the leading propaganda outlets since January 28. There have been periods in the past where he has “disappeared” from view for several days, but this “absence” in the midst of a crisis is spurring rumors even faster than usual. I am not buying the rumors going around that he is sick or been removed in a coup, and I caution readers against putting much stock in those. One of the key political tasks of all party members is to protect the core, i.e. Xi Jinping, and while you would think the “people’s leader” would want to be seen close to the people perhaps in this case the risk of him catching the virus may be too high, and images of him wearing a mask might be anathema to the propaganda wizards. That said, I do not know what is going on, it is something I am paying a lot of attention to, but in the absence of any evidence I remain skeptical of the rumors. I will bet that Xi and the other top leaders in the Party and the military understand that they either all hang together in this crisis or they may all hang separately, to paraphrase Benjamin Franklin. This is a long issue, I recommend you click on the headline at the top of this post to read it in full in your browser. Thanks for reading.",0
"EBONY Announces EBONYCon, a 4-Day Virtual Conference Providing Resources to Black Community in the Midst of COVID-19","For over 75 years, EBONY and JET Magazines have been on the frontlines of social and civil injustice. The EBONY Foundation, the national nonprofit arm of EBONY Capital Partners, LLC, was established to take a grassroots approach to community outreach. In keeping with its charter, the organization is launching a 4-day virtual event and weekend, beginning Friday, April 24th, focused on providing resources and information to the black community in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. A dedicated website for the conference is www.ebonyjet.org . The first day of the conference will focus on bringing support and healing to religious institutions. Churches will learn how to benefit from the landmark decision deeming faith-based organizations eligible for federal government relief. Speakers scheduled to appear, include Senator Tim Scott,(R-SC),Rev.Dr.Samuel C. Tolbert Jr., president of the National Baptist Convention of America International Inc. (NBCA). Day two of EBONYCon in partnership with the National Black Business League will be a series of master classes on fostering entrepreneurship and how to survive and thrive during this pandemic. Speakers scheduled include corporate and entertainment lawyer Walter Mosley, Brittney Escovedo, founder of Beyond8, and Dr. George C. Fraser, recently named “Black America’s #1 Networker” by Black Enterprise Magazine and one of the “Top 50 Power Brokers in Black America” by UPSCALE Magazine. Day three of EBONYCon will focus on providing health and wellness information and resources to the black community. Speakers scheduled include cardiologist William James Mosley II, MD and include a morning workout session with celebrity trainer Agostina Laneri. The final day of EBONYCon is dedicated to highlighting active entrepreneurs, scientists, activists, and thought leaders in the cannabis industry. EBONYCon’s cannabis segment will begin with a “Run 2 High” virtual 5k race, and session topics including “Excellence in Cannabis Medicine,” “Excellence in Cannabis Business,” “Women of Cannabis,” and” Excellence in Cannabis Advocacy,” to name a few. EBONYCon’s cannabis day will feature speakers including renowned cannabis scientist Dr. Rachel Knox, founder of American Cannabinoid Clinics, cannabis accounting expert, and founder of Dope CFO, Naomi Granger, and Dr. Sandra Carrillo, co-CEO, SaviAndina Organics, among others. Cannabis business connector, and writer, Andre Bourque, calls the virtual conference a first step for the media organization. “This is foundational to building a cannabis vertical for this historical brand, dedicated to people of color,” said Mr. Bourque.",0
Corona and sport cancellations: China stops doping controls,"0 Share W does he remember Zika? Long time no longer heard. In February 2016, five months before the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared global health emergency due to the mosquito-borne virus. The games were held under safety precautions, and the WHO lifted the state of emergency in November 2016. In November 2019, the Federal Foreign Office’s health service announced that the number of cases in Central and South America was declining. So much for the good news. The bad news: the corona virus causes far more problems than Zika. The disease has long led to cancellations. The Formula E race planned for March 21 in Sanya on the Chinese holiday island of Hainan is canceled. The same is threatening the Formula 1 Grand Prix, which is to be held at Shanghai four weeks later. At the end of last week, the organizers of the Tokyo Olympic Games had to emphasize that a cancellation of the games is currently not being considered. On Monday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said they were working with the WHO to avoid negative effects on the games. Olympic organizers and association officials want to advise on how to deal with the virus. Since the weekend, Japan has been refusing entry to foreigners who have been in the Chinese province of Hubei in the past two weeks. Even people who have a passport issued in Hubei are no longer allowed to go to Japan. Manon Priebe Recommendations: 54 In Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s government imposed an almost complete ban on travelers from China. Exceptions are made only for Australian citizens, permanent residents and their relatives. The conservative head of government, heavily criticized for the ongoing climate and bushfire crisis, is resorting to rigorous means. The Asian Football Confederation is quickly coming under pressure. She had placed Chinese clubs’ home games at the end of the Champions League group stage at the end of next week – and more likely to give them a competitive advantage. However, Shanghai Shenhua is due to start in Perth next Tuesday, Shanghai SIPG the next day at Sydney FC – impossible under Morrison’s policies. This Tuesday, the East Asian associations want to advise how to deal with the Corona crisis. Hosting in a neutral place? That would not do justice to the fear of contagion expressed in Morrison’s entry ban, as it may seem exaggerated. Shift? Cancellation? The continental futsal tournament, scheduled for three weeks in Turkmenistan, has been postponed indefinitely. This also shows that Corona has been the greatest health challenge in sport in recent years. China’s anti-doping agency said on Monday that it had decided to suspend doping controls until further notice. Health protection is given as the reason. Who is this good news for? Not for equal opportunities, viewed objectively. If you look at doping plans from the past, you have black and white in front of you: the best performances of summer are made in winter. And how much of the competition is infected by the suspicion is not only demonstrated by every start of the Chinese swimmer Sun Yang. In any case, nothing can be heard of the end of the cynicism, which has already and especially in China, won in the fight of the Communist Party against Corona. ,",0
The Corona Virus—1918 All Over Again?,"Clusters of a dozen or so deaths may get nonstop “if-it-bleeds-it-leads” press coverage. But the lack of preparedness for the really, really big threats may be met with virtual radio silence—until panic breaks out. The worst, possibly existential, threat is the stealthy, invisible one that multiplies exponentially—in the accurate sense of the term: 400 cases today, 800 tomorrow, then 1600, 3200, 6400, 128000, 256000, 512000, and 1.024 million after only eight doubling times. Biological threats proliferate—until they run out of susceptible victims. In 1918, the great influenza pandemic killed as many people in 11 months as the medieval Black Death did in 4 years. Ultimately, at least 50 million may have perished. Young healthy people, especially young soldiers headed off to the front in World War I, succumbed quickly. To avoid interfering with the war effort, the U.S. government denied and covered up the threat, preventing the implementation of public health measures. Since then, the world has gotten smaller. A virus that jumps the species barrier from animals to humans in a meat market in China can cross the Pacific in hours. And despite the expenditure of $80 billion on a National Biologic Defense, the U.S. is arguably no better prepared than it was in 1918, state Steven Hatfill, M.D., and coauthors in their new book Three Seconds until Midnight . As in 1918, we lack a vaccine or wonder drugs, but must rely on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), and on public health authorities to track and try to contain the spread of infection. Accurate information is critical. Can we trust governmental authorities to tell the truth? Travel restrictions, quarantine, closing businesses, and cancelling public events have a huge economic and potential political cost. There can also be incentives to exaggerate the threat, in order to sell poorly tested vaccines or drugs. The 1976 swine flu epidemic was almost a non-event; more people were probably injured or even died from adverse effects of the heavily promoted vaccine. The World Health Organization (WHO) has so far declined to declare the corona virus outbreak a global emergency, although cases have been reported in more than a dozen or so countries. China reported only hundreds of “confirmed” cases—while countless additional cases were not tested because of lack of diagnostic test kits. The New England Journal of Medicine writes , “Another Decade, Another Coronavirus.” This 2019-nCoV virus is the third zoonotic (animal) coronavirus to infect humans in two decades. The SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) were contained. Other coronaviruses cause mild cold-like syndromes. This virus has occasioned the quarantine of entire cities, for the first time since medieval times. This could not be done other than in authoritarian China, states virologist Steven Hatfill , but even there is unlikely to be effective—especially if 5 million people had left before the order was implemented. The People’s Liberation Army has sent 450 medical personnel to Wuhan to help out at local hospitals, which are crammed with patients lying in packed corridors. Construction workers are reportedly trying to build a 1,000-bed hospital in Wuhan in five days. The U.S. and other nations are evacuating their citizens from Wuhan. A report of 41 hospitalized patients in Wuhan, published in The Lancet , showed that patients were relatively young (median age 49) and fewer than half had an underlying illness. Only 66% had been exposed to the Huanan seafood market, the apparent source of the infection. One patient (2%) had no fever; all had pneumonia; 29% had severe respiratory distress syndrome; and 12% had acute cardiac injury. Most cases may be very mild, facilitating more rapid spread . The corona virus is transmitted by droplets coming into contact with mucous membranes, including the eye. It can persist on surfaces for days. People without fever or symptoms can transmit the illness during the incubation period, which might be as long as two weeks. At present, definitive diagnostic testing is available only from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) . In a severe outbreak, people whose job is not critical may need to stay home. Those who do not have a supply of food, essential medications, or other needed supplies would likely end up in a frantic crowd. Personal protective gear, for people who need to be in contact with the public or care for a sick family member, is already out of stock in medical supply houses. This includes gloves, wrap-around eye protection, and N-95 protective masks—regular surgical masks are probably of little help. Panic is never helpful; staying calm is always good advice. But failure to heed previous warnings of the need for robust disaster planning, and complacency about medical technology and governmental resources, has set the stage for potential unprecedented disaster. Individuals need to recognize that they themselves, and not 911 or the emergency room or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, may hold the key to their family’s and their community’s survival. Local authorities need to know that they may be on their own. For now, stock up on supplies; cover those coughs and sneezes; wash hands frequently for at least 20 seconds; avoid crowds; and stay aware, as the situation could change rapidly. Jane Orient Jane M.

Fox News Devotes Entire Segment to Mocking COVID-19 Positive CNN Anchors,"Fox News’ Laura Ingraham took a break from misleading viewers about all things coronavirus to disparage those at CNN who have shared their experiences while battling the virus. On Wednesday night, Ingraham, who regularly trolls in dangerous coronavirus advice like touting untested drugs and encouraging people to take part in anti-stay-at-home protests , devoted more than five minutes of her program to talk smack about the newscasters, complete with pre-packaged graphics. Guest Raymond Arroyo began the segment by panning CNN’s talent — Chris Cuomo, Brooke Baldwin, and Richard Quest — who have, in one way or another, spoken on-air about contracting the virus and its ramifications. “Laura, the first rule of journalism is: don’t inject yourself into the story,” Arroyo snarked, adding, “But there seems to be a deliberate attempt to graft a slew of CNN anchors onto this COVID crisis.” “A number of them have contracted the virus and emoted their personal experiences,” Arroyo continued. “It almost appears they’ve launched a series of new reality shows. You could call this one ‘Are You Sicker Than a CNN Anchor?’” A colorful graphic appeared then on-screen with the name of the faux reality show Arroyo had just suggested, followed by a mash-up of CNN journalists detailing their experiences with the virus. After the montage, Arroyo put aside the fact that he first presented the segment by chuckling with Ingraham when rolling out the silly reality show name and graphic and said, “Laura, the self-referential emoting is what is so galling. People are dying and losing their livelihoods. Chances are, young and healthy anchors will not succumb to the disease.” Arroyo continued, “And to keep this narrative going every night that’s so personal, it is disturbing. Because you lose all perspective. It is great to have perspective, but to become the story is a big problem here. And CNN really should tamp down their personal stories. It’s too much.” Ingraham then chimed in saying she’s “glad [the CNN newscasters] are ok.” But she followed that expression wishing them well with an ironic take that was rather astonishing. “I don’t really get it,” Ingraham said of the newsworthiness of CNN’s coverage. “Is that the news?” Ingraham asked. Asking “Is that news?” while in the midst of a five-minute jokey segment on the topic during one the higher-rated, primetime programs on a so-called news channel is rich. If CNN anchors contracting a virus in the middle of a pandemic is not news, why is Ingraham covering it? Like Arroyo just said in this very segment, “People are dying and losing their livelihoods.” But of course, the two went right back to the comedy portion of the COVID-19 segment by again mocking particular incidents and anchors, which included another prepackaged graphic that made fun of Anderson Cooper.",0
Drug-gene testing could give experts insight into COVID-19 treatment,"Print Thousands of clinical trials have launched in an effort to better understand the SARS-CoV-2 virus and in search of drugs to successfully treat the symptoms of infection. While these studies are ongoing, doctors are scrambling to make treatment decisions for severely ill COVID-19 patients based on limited, anecdotal evidence on safety and efficacy. This uncertainty is prompting some questions about whether pharmacogenetics may be useful in helping guide treatment decisions, perhaps by identifying those who might respond particularly well to a drug, or alternatively, by flagging patients who may be at risk for life-threatening adverse events because of genetic factors or other drugs they might be taking. Specifically, since some of the most talked about and controversial drugs being tried for COVID-19 carry the risk of arrhythmias and sudden death, experts believe there may be a role for PGx testing in identifying patients who are already genetically predisposed to such adverse events with drugs they're taking. Knowing this information in advance, they said, could help physicians make more informed treatment choices. For experimental COVID-19 treatment modalities where there may not be clear evidence of a drug/gene interaction, experts hope that the ongoing drug studies in which researchers are exploring the role of biomarkers will yield more definitive data. Ultimately, however, the real utility of PGx testing may not be in helping guide treatments for COVID-19, some predict, but as a supportive tool during the mental health pandemic that will follow. Managing risks Houda Hachad, CSO of precision medicine developer Translational Software, said there's the potential that PGx testing could help avoid drug-drug-gene interactions with hydroxychloroquine, which is currently approved to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus. This drug, however, is known to cause arrhythmias in patients with existing cardiovascular disease, who also happen to be at increased risk for COVID-19. This week, a panel of experts convened by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases recommended that doctors not prescribe hydroxychloroquine together with the antibiotic azithromycin — a combination promoted by President Donald Trump — because of the risk of sudden cardiac death and QTc prolongation, a heart rhythm disorder that can potentially cause fast, chaotic heartbeats. The American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and Heart Rhythm Society have cautioned the same. The expert groups recommend closely monitoring the heart rhythms of patients on these drugs, and if possible, avoiding other QTc prolonging therapies. Hachad noted that when patients are evaluated for the risk for QTc prolongation, physicians use a scoring system that factors in the QTc prolonging drugs they're already taking. PGx testing can be helpful in this context, by identifying individuals with certain CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 genotypes that place them at increased risk for cardiac events if they are already on a long list of frequently prescribed drugs. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration lists several of the drugs that carry the risk of QTc prolongation in its recently published ""Table of Pharmacogenetic Associations."" According to this table, individuals who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers are at greater risk than normal metabolizers for QTc prolongation if they are receiving the antidepressant citalopram. Based on expert guidelines and FDA prescribing label information, CYP2C19 poor metabolizers should receive a lower dose of the drug. Citalopram was the 26th most prescribed drug in the U.S., with more than 24 million scripts written in 2017. If a patient who metabolizes CYP2C19 poorly was on citalopram and also received hydroxychloroquine, it could compound their risk for life-threatening arrhythmias. According to Hachad, there are numerous other examples like this where PGx information can help doctors more accurately gauge patients' cumulative risk for QT prolongation when considering whether to treat a COVID-19 patient with a drug combination like hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. An app to inform the public In the process of writing a review on drugs that are currently being tried for COVID-19, pharmacogenetics expert Howard McLeod noted that there was no place for the general public to input the drugs they are on and educate themselves about the potential drug/gene, drug/drug, or drug/disease interactions they may be at risk for if they became infected with the virus and had to go on an experimental therapy. Meanwhile, demand for hydroxychloroquine has surged despite a lack of evidence supporting its use in COVID-19 patients outside of clinical trials. Amid the hype and politics around this drug, one of McLeod's colleagues was wondering whether to use hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis and entered the drug into a medication management app called Pharmazam. It revealed that since he was already on an antifungal fluconazole, he would be at risk for long QT syndrome if he took hydroxychloroquine. In terms of the PGx interactions the app may flag that may be of interest in the context of the pandemic, Taimour Langaee CSO of biotech firm Pharmazam highlighted that polymorphisms in ABCC1 and SLCO1B1 transporters, and G6PD, are known to cause adverse effects from hydroxychloroquine. Additionally, with antiviral drugs, such as ritonavir and lopinavir, which are also being tried for COVID-19, there are transporters, as well as CYP450 and glucuronidation variants, that may impact response. Using pharmacogenetics to guide treatment choice, on the other hand, has had a hard slog in terms of gaining acceptance in mainstream medical circles. Many doctors have resisted incorporating information from PGx testing into their day-to-day workflows, except in very limited circumstances where there is a risk of a life-threatening adverse event. There is still differing views in medical circles regarding the utility of PGx testing to dose warfarin or clopidogrel, despite guidelines and FDA labeling supporting testing. Physician reluctance continues to be an issue in the adoption of PGx testing, McLeod acknowledged, adding that ""the healthcare system needs to be ready in order to get the full benefits of this sort of application."" Additionally, while doctors are trying to treat patients in an emergent crisis, pharmacogenetics may not be top of mind, and likely to be ignored when there is unclear messaging from health regulators about when to test patients for PGx variants that may be at issue with experimental COVID-19 drugs. For example, the FDA-approved labels for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine state that these drugs should be prescribed with caution in patients with G6PD deficiency, since they may be at increased risk for hemolytic anemia — where the body breaks down red blood cells faster than it can replenish them. However, the FDA labels don't explicitly recommend PGx testing. Similarly, when the FDA put out a fact sheet for healthcare providers about the emergency use authorization of hydroxychloroquine, the agency noted that hemolytic anemia has been seen in G6PD-deficient patients, but again, doesn't provide any guidance on testing. Advancing research ""There does seem to be some mixed messaging about G6PD"" deficiency and hydroxychloroquine, noted Michelle Whirl-Carrillo, director of PharmGKB, an online knowledgebase of expertly curated information on the role of genetic variants on drug response. PharmGKB recently launched an online COVID-19 resource to help identify drug-drug interactions. The webpage lists the drugs involved in COVID-19 trials and which of those have PGx information within PharmGKB, and notes the drugs associated with long QT syndrome. There is also a listing of genes implicated in drug adverse events and metabolism, as well as the genes involved in allowing SARS-CoV-2 viral cell entry and infection. The bolus of drug and genomics research occurring during the pandemic is an opportunity to assess whether there is a role for genetics in personalizing COVID-19 treatment. Teri Klein, a principal investigator for PharmGKB, estimated there are more than 6,000 COVID-19 related peer-reviewed papers that have been published in the couple of months since the pandemic started. ""In the next month or so, we really will have a much better understanding of a number of these drugs,"" Klein said, noting that many of the experimental drug studies have rapidly enrolled and are expecting readouts on efficacy and safety relatively quickly. ""In clinical trials, often you have a hard time getting a cohort,"" she said. ""Unfortunately, given the circumstances, we don't have difficulty getting people to sign up for these experimental treatments."" Within Pharmazam's COVID19 PGx Project, experts are hoping to learn more about the pharmacogenetics of drugs being tried for COVID-19 and exploring the genetic factors that might make an individual more susceptible to infection and to experiencing severe symptoms. Particularly of interest within the project are ACE2 and TMPRSS2, genes that play role in allowing the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter a cell and infect it. Other research teams are also studying these genes and have already identified certain ACE2 polymorphisms that appear to make patients more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Kristine Ashcraft, former CEO of YouScript, a medication management decision support tool provider, believes that the broader value proposition for PGx as a tool to keep patients out of the emergency room and hospitals is particularly relevant during this pandemic. Studies show patients who get genetic testing are less likely to end up in the emergency room or hospital for a serious adverse event. Managing the mental health pandemic While researchers are working to advance drugs to treat COVID-19 and vaccines to give people immunity against the virus, the mental health impact of the pandemic will also have to be managed. This is where PGx testing may be most useful, experts in the field said. ""It is worthwhile to consider not just the utility of PGx in preventing hospitalization or changing the course of COVID-19 care,"" but also the impact it could have on managing ""the burden on the patients that do survive a COVID-19 infection … [and] those that are suffering from the isolation of social distancing, as well as the financial hardships,"" said David Thacker, a clinical pharmacogenetics content specialist at Translational Software. According to a recent JAMA editorial, during the SARS outbreak in 2003, there was a greater incidence of post-traumatic stress syndrome and psychological distress among patients and doctors. In communities impacted by Hurricane Ike in 2008, around 5% of individuals met the criteria for major depressive disorder, while one in 10 adults in New York City had symptoms of the disorder after 9/11. ""In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it appears likely that there will be substantial increases in anxiety and depression, substance use, loneliness, and domestic violence; and with schools closed, there is a very real possibility of an epidemic of child abuse,"" wrote Sandro Galea from Boston University School of Public Health, Raina Merchant from the Perelman School of Medicine, and Nicole Lurie from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations in Norway. A survey in March by the American Psychiatric Association found that more than a third of polled individuals said that the pandemic was seriously impacting their mental health, nearly half said they were scared about getting the virus, and 62% said they feared a loved one would get it. Meanwhile, calls to substance abuse and mental health help lines increased eightfold from February to March. As the pandemic continues, people may increasingly turn to medications to deal with the psychological wounds left by the pandemic. Drugs to treat mental health conditions, including major depressive disorder, are some of the most widely prescribed drugs in the U.S., but they're also highly variable and associated with unwanted side effects. As such, one of the main areas where PGx testing has seen uptake is for personalizing psychiatry drugs. Myriad Genetics recently published a meta-analysis involving more than 1,500 patients with major depressive disorder who were enrolled in four studies, which showed that patients who received treatment based on PGx information had significantly better outcomes than those who did not. Although PGx testing in psychiatry is not without its naysayers, doctors may reach for such testing if the use of mental health drugs increases during or after the pandemic. Genomind, a mental health-focused PGx testing company, recently took a number of steps to make it easier for physicians to deliver psychiatric care during the pandemic. Doctors can order Genomind's PGx test and send a saliva collection kit to patient's homes, which can then be mailed to the lab for analysis. Through Genomind, doctors also have access to Sharecare's HIPAA-compliant telemedicine platform for free until September, which they can use to remotely see patients and discuss PGx test results, if ordered. ""The utility of PGx during the COVID-19 crisis is more important than ever,"" a spokesperson for the company said. ""This service is helping enable critical mental health treatment during the pandemic and Genomind is doing its best to enable as many mental health professionals as possible.""",0
FAUCI ABOUT-FACE: ‘PROLONGED’ LOCKDOWNS NOT THE WAY TO GO,"After insisting for months that lockdowns were necessary to fight the coronavirus, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases chief Dr. Anthony Fauci now says that “prolonged shutdowns” will damage America if it’s not reopened soon.  Fauci, the institutional face of the coronavirus response and head of the White House coronavirus Task Force, suddenly changed his tune this week about reopening the country despite advocating for shutdowns just days earlier.  “I don’t want people to think that any of us feel that staying locked down for a prolonged period of time is the way to go,” Fauci said Friday on CNBC. “Now is the time, depending upon where you are and what your situation is — is to begin to seriously [look] at reopening the economy, reopening the country to try and get back to some degree of normal. I’m totally in favor of that, if done in the proper way, in the appropriate setting.”  “In general, I think most of the country is doing it in a prudent way. There are obviously some situations where people might be jumping over that. I just say please proceed with caution if you’re going to do that,” Fauci added.  Fauci’s sudden change of heart regarding the lock downs caught the attention of Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, who criticized Fauci during “Tucker Carlson” tonight.  “I don’t mean to pile on Fauci, but we are making very important decisions based on what he’s saying,” Portnoy told host Tucker Carlson on Friday, “and I think it’s OK to say ‘I really don’t know, guys.'” “But I get the feeling if you asked him this question, or ‘What does one plus one equal?’ you’re going to get seven different answers.”  “I think at this point, you let people — individuals — make decisions for themselves,” he added. “The only thing, as I said before, that we absolutely know for certain is if you continue the quarantine, tons of people are going to lose their livelihoods.” Fauci, Big Pharma and the Mainstream Media would have you believe that vaccine injuries are RARE, but when the reports start piling up of all the damage caused by the exact vaccines Fauci has touted, it’s important to start asking how rare they actually are…",0

Government health agency official: Corona virus 'isn't something the American public need to worry about',"Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), said Sunday the American public shouldn’t worry about the coronavirus outbreak in China. “It’s a very, very low risk to the United States,” Fauci said during an interview with radio show host John Catsimatidis. “But it’s something that we as public health officials need to take very seriously... It isn’t something the American public needs to worry about or be frightened about. Because we have ways of preparing and screening of people coming in [from China]. And we have ways of responding - like we did with this one case in Seattle, Washington, who had traveled to China and brought back the infection.” The World Health Organization (WHO) reported on Saturday that there are 1,320 confirmed cases of the virus worldwide, only two are in the U.S. and the majority are centered in China. Fauci went on to explain that since it is a virus, there are limited remedies to combat it or develop immunity among a population. He said NIAID is working on a vaccine, though it will be about three months until they can begin testing it on humans. “We’ve just got to make sure that we are totally prepared [since] infectious diseases will continue to emerge on the human species. And we’ve got to be essentially perpetually prepared.” It remains unclear how long the virus will be active in China, where over 30 million people in the Wuhan, China area have been quarantined so far. On Saturday, it was reported that the U.S. government is preparing a charter flight this weekend to evacuate American citizens and diplomats from Wuhan. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced Saturday that it is moving a qualifying event from Wuhan, China, to Amman, Jordan, over concerns about the outbreak. John Catsimatidis is an investor in The Hill. Most Popular Video",0

Is Corona Beer experiencing the AIDS/Ayds effect?,"“Gentlemen, we know the problem. The question is, what will we do about it?” “I have an idea, sir, but it’s pretty radical.” “This is no time for caution, son! Let’s hear it!” “Well, sir, what if we stuck the word ‘diet’ in front of the word everyone associates with a fatal and socially stigmatized illness?” “You mean, rename AYDS to Diet AYDS?” “Er… in a nutshell, yes, sir.” “My god.

Most people associated the name Anthrax with the band, not the germ. Now in the wake of those events, our name symbolizes fear, paranoia and death. Suddenly our name is not so cool.

It became more sobering when I talked with my mom(a labor and delivery nurse at a hospital in a lower income part of San Diego) and the beginning impacts at her work.

"Corona-phobia: Like SARS, coronavirus fear feeds racism","I went home and wiped every item I had bought. And then I thought, ""You bl**dy fool, Zulfikar! You bl**dy racist fool!"" Read more: German coronavirus evacuee describes life in quarantine That poor couple, out doing the weekly shop like me, must have felt so objectified and they may not have even been Chinese, or from Wuhan. Or again, like me, a half-Indian who's never been to India, they may have never visited the country of their parents or grandparents birth. Corkscrew of fear and loathing The current case of coronavirus is a little complicated. To start with we're dealing with a relatively unknown virus. Scientists don't know enough to understand how it spreads or develops, and as a result, how it can be stopped. And that sense of ""unknown unknowns,"" to misquote yet again, this time former US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , is a natural breeding ground for fear, irrational feelings of distrust, disgust, hate, racism and xenophobia. That U.N. report describes xenophobia as including behavior that rejects, excludes and vilifies people ""based on the perception "" that they are ""outsiders."" Medically justified as they may be, national programs that remove and quarantine ""plane loads"" of people from Wuhan to Australia's Christmas Island or to military bases in the UK feeds into such perceptions. As with the Biblical reference, Rumsfeld was not for nothing either. Rumsfeld and the George Bush Junior administration he served between 2001 and 2006 used that sense of unknown threats to leverage support for a Middle East war and an Islamophobia, encouraged with images of bearded Muslim bogeymen, which quickly transpired. As far away from China as El Salvador: Thermographic imaging of air travellers But then, when it comes to China, what extra leverage do people need? We in the ""West"" already harbor feelings of distrust and xenophobia against the Chinese state and the people who live there — whether they're Chinese or not. We're perfectly happy to buy the iPhones they manufacture, but we sure as Hinnom don't want the Chinese firm Huawei anywhere near our 5G networks . They will spy on us, surely. And it's happened before The trouble is, we often don't even realize we're doing it. Which is part of the same kind of complacency and idiocy inherent in racism itself. So, for instance, UC Berkley may have thought it was doing students a favor when the university's health center said that ""normal reactions"" to coronavirus included panic, anger, hyper-vigilance to health and … wait for it … xenophobia. But is it really? Normal? I suppose if a lot of people feel that way, you could say it is kind of normal. But that doesn't make it right. UC Berkeley was accused of ""normalizing racism"" (as reported in the The Washington Post ) and apologized for the advice (my emphasis). Only I would say a certain level of normalization is necessary. Without normalization, we can go on refusing to accept that racism or xenophobia, and the irrational psychological feelings that feed them, exist and need to be handled head-on. After all, we have been here before. In 2004, a year after the outbreak of SARS in Asia, researchers wrote about "" SARS-related fear, stigmatization, and discrimination ."" In an opinion piece for The New York Times , Iris Chang wrote about "" Fear of SARS, Fear of Strangers ,"" and led with a line about UC Berkeley (them again?) banning students from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore from all its summer programs. And those left behind in Wuhan ... Left to clean and rid the city of the virus Avoidance psychology But these feelings of fear work like a corkscrew — they drill deep and risk fracturing any brittle constitution. These feelings can also endanger the perpetrators themselves. In 2004, a paper about the "" psychology behind the masks "" referred to ""two diseases looming"" — one, the virus itself and two, that of a psychological nature. The authors write about ""panic-stricken people"" mobbing stores after a fake news article said Hong Kong would be sealed off from the world. Then, a man from Taiwan committed suicide in a hospital ward because he suspected family members had contracted the then-fatal virus. An evident, yet anecdotal, SARS-phobia was rearing its head. Now we have Corona-phobia. None of this helps anyone. In fact, it's like the 1980s panic around HIV. The unthinking among us believed we could only get HIV if we were gay or bisexual. But as early as 1988 researchers knew that wasn't true . Watch video 01:07",0
COVID-19 takes unequal toll on immigrants in Nordic region,"Sadad Dakhare (R), his father Mohamed Dakhare Farah and niece Safa Mohamed Hassan (L) who fell ill with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) but have now recovered. The first person in Sadad Dakhare's two-bedroom apartment in Oslo, Norway, to show symptoms was his 4-year-old niece. Next, his mother, his sister and he himself fell ill. Then, about a week after his niece became sick, Dakhare heard his 76-year-old father coughing heavily. He found his father lying in bed, gasping for air. ""Just call an ambulance,"" the father told Dakhare. At an Oslo hospital, Dakhare's father tested positive for COVID-19 and was treated for a few days before he was discharged to finish his recovery at home. The Dakhare family's story is a familiar one among Somalis in Norway and other Nordic countries, where the pandemic is taking a disproportionate toll on some immigrant groups. Governments in Sweden, Norway and Finland are taking extra steps to try to slow the spread of the disease in these communities. Across Europe, little is known about who is affected by the virus because governments are releasing limited demographic information about the sick and those who die. But a Reuters examination of government data in three Nordic countries where more details are available shows that some immigrant groups are among those affected at higher rates than the general populace. ""WORRYING"" DISPARITY In Norway, where 15% of residents were born abroad, 25% who had tested positive for COVID-19 by April 19 were foreign-born. Somalis, with 425 confirmed cases, are the largest immigrant group testing positive, accounting for 6% of all confirmed cases -- more than 10 times their share of the population. Somalis are the most overrepresented immigrant group among Sweden's confirmed cases, as well. Their 283 positive tests account for about 5% of the nearly 6,000 cases documented between March 13 and April 7. That's seven times their share of the population. Iraqis, Syrians and Turks also made up disproportionately large shares of positive cases. In Finland's capital city of Helsinki, the mayor said it was ""worrying"" that almost 200 Somalis had tested positive by mid-April. They accounted for about 17% of positive cases -- 10 times their share of the city's population. More than 100,000 Somalia-born live in the three countries, mostly in Sweden and Norway, one of the largest Somali diasporas in the world. Many arrived as refugees of war in the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. Several factors place them more at risk of getting sick, public health officials and researchers say. VIRUS OUTPACES RESPONSE It is common in all three countries for multiple generations of Somalis to live, like the Dakhares do, in crowded apartments, making it easier for the virus to spread from one family member to the next. They also tend to work in high-contact jobs -- healthcare workers, drivers and cleaners, for example -- with a higher risk for exposure. Language barriers also are at play, and some have criticized governments in Sweden and Norway for failing to move fast enough in communicating about the virus to immigrant groups. ""By the time information translated to different languages was spread sufficiently, the infection rate among minority groups was already very high,"" said Linda Noor, a social anthropologist who is managing director of Minotenk, a think tank focused on minority-related politics in Norway. She said a lot of information in Norway was distributed through national health authorities' websites that are unfamiliar to many people in immigrant communities. Public health officials in both Norway and Sweden pointed to COVID-19 information they published in multiple languages, including Somali, in early to mid-March. But they acknowledged that they did not reach some immigrants fast enough. GETTING THE WORD OUT ""I think it is clear from the epidemiological situation, especially looking at the high proportion of Somalis with COVID-19, that we did not reach this group in time,"" said Hilde Kløvstad, department director at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Once the virus started to spread, officials realized they needed to be more focused in their outreach, she said, adding that the spread of the virus among immigrant communities is slowing. In Oslo, officials contacted leaders in immigrant communities, who helped them get the word out via social media, word of mouth, posters and online videos targeting Somalis, said Hanne Gjørtz, head of communications for the city. Health alerts in Somali aired on the radio, and text messages with translated information were sent to Somali residents. ""We saw that this led to increased traffic on our websites,"" she said. ""But we are constantly learning,"" she added. ""It would definitely have been an advantage to have videos and posters in place earlier in this crisis. This has been and still is a crisis of great speed, and it took some time for us to find the right ways to reach different groups."" HITTING THE STREETS In Rinkeby-Kista and Spånga-Tensta, two Stockholm boroughs where immigrants and their children make up most of the population, rates of infection are more than two times higher than in the city overall. Trying to slow the spread of the virus in these areas, where Somalis are the biggest minority group, the government is offering temporary furnished rental apartments to at-risk-groups, such as elderly people who live in multi-generational housing, said Benjamin Dousa, chairman of the Rinkeby-Kista district council. Government workers who speak a variety of languages, including Somali, have hit the streets in immigrant-heavy neighborhoods -- near libraries, religious buildings, municipal offices, metro stations and grocery stores -- to warn people about COVID-19, said officials from government body Region Stockholm. In a statement to Reuters, Region Stockholm said it could have been faster in distributing multilingual information before the virus began spreading disproportionately among immigrant groups. ""However, we are working in the middle of a situation which is before unseen,"" the statement said. ""Therefore, it is difficult to be as fast as is needed and to foresee all needs."" The statement added that the infection rate is slowing in Spånga-Tensta and Rinkeby-Kista. ""SITUATION DEMANDS TEAMWORK"" Helsinki is gearing up for similar outreach. ""The situation demands enhanced teamwork, continued development of multilingual services and effective targeted communications,"" said Mayor Jan Vapaavuori. ""We have entered into discussions with the Finnish Somali League about new measures to improve the situation."" Somalis themselves also are trying to spread the word about how to stay safe. Ayan Abdulle posted an informational video on Facebook, but she found she wasn't reaching the people who needed the information most. Abdulle, 29, who was born in Somalia and came to Norway at age 9, heads a non-governmental organization in the city of Bergen called Arawelo, which usually focuses on helping young immigrants apply for jobs and find friends. After the coronavirus outbreak, Abdulle started to focus on the elderly as well, helping them with grocery shopping. When she spoke with elderly Somali women out shopping last month, she learned they were not getting enough information about the coronavirus because they weren't using social media and not all of them understood Norwegian.

What does it mean now that 2 cats tested positive for COVID-19?,"Two pet cats in New York state tested positive for the new coronavirus this week, marking the first time a pet in the United States has tested positive for COVID-19. Following the news, many viewers reached out to VERIFY with their questions. So we tackled some of your most common questions about your furry family members and coronavirus. THE QUESTIONS Is it possible my pets could further spread the disease? Are my pets in danger? Is testing pets using possible tests for people? THE ANSWER The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently advises that there is no evidence that pets play a significant role in spreading the coronavirus. Still, they urge you to exercise caution when taking care of your pet amidst this pandemic. Both of the cats in question had mild cases and are recovering, according to officials. There are currently no cases of an animal having severe COVID-19 symptoms. The USDA said COVID-19 testing for pets does not hinder testing for humans in any way. WHAT WE FOUND So first, let’s go over exactly what happened to these cats. The USDA says both cats were from New York state, although they were from different parts of the state and their illnesses were unrelated. Both of them have mild respiratory symptoms but both are expected to make a full recovery. The owner of one cat had COVID-19 prior to the cat showing signs of illness while no one in the other cat’s household has had the illness yet. The USDA said it’s possible the cat got the illness from an asymptomatic carrier in the house or contact with an infected person outside the home. These are the first confirmed instances in the U.S. of pets contracting COVID-19. In response, CDC updated their guidance involving animals and coronavirus. RELATED: Two pet cats in New York state test positive for coronavirus RELATED: Tiger at New York City's Bronx Zoo tests positive for coronavirus Originally, the CDC stated that pets were unlikely to be at risk of getting COVID-19 because they had no evidence of pets getting the disease. The CDC now advises that you treat pets like you would humans in your household -- don’t let them come in close contact with strangers and keep people diagnosed with COVID-19 away from pets. The CDC also added that the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to humans is low “based on the limited information available to date.” They say there is no evidence pets play a significant role in spreading the virus. So far, four animals in the U.S. have tested positive for COVID-19, according to the USDA’s list . All four have been felines in the state of New York. The first confirmed case involved a tiger in a New York zoo and the second was a lion also in a New York zoo. The USDA does not currently recommend routine animal testing for COVID-19. Still, they maintain it does not impair human testing at all. In the agency's animal testing FAQ , the USDA explained tests for animals use reagents not required for human COVID-19 tests and thus should not reduce the availability of tests for people. The tests are performed by veterinarians instead of doctors. So, what are some big takeaways from all of this? Yes, your pet can get COVID-19 so you should avoid cuddling it if you’re sick and you shouldn’t let strangers pet it for the time being. So far, all pets with coronavirus have had mild symptoms and testing these animals has not impacted human testing at all. Have something you'd like VERIFIED?",0
How to Win an Argument with God: A Lesson Sponsored by the Corona Virus,"Ever since I participated in debate competitions in high school and maybe before, I have relished the occasional thrill of winning an argument against a smart opponent. Forgive me for bragging, but I can rightfully boast some pretty impressive victories, especially my many victories against the smartest opponent of all: God. That sounds pretty amazing, I know, but I've discovered that it's relatively easy to win arguments against Him. In fact, I won several in a row in the past few weeks. The key to winning the argument is first listening so you can know what to argue against. Prayer is a great way to get started. Pray and seek for guidance in some aspect of your life. Humbly sense that guidance. Feel free to write it down. And then, think carefully of all the reasons why it is ridiculous and doesn't apply to you. Strong logical skills are a plus here if you want a decisive victory. Provide your reasons, dismiss His suggestion, and voila, you are likely to win because I've found that He often doesn't do much of a rebuttal. God, in fact, is a terrible debater. No offense, but it's true. In debate, after one side critiques your proposal, it's important to carefully respond to and rebut each argument they have raised. God, I'm sad to say, is rather week in this regard. Although He's the Ultimate in intelligence, His mastery of debate techniques seems to pale in comparison with the skills most of us mortals have. For example, two months ago, in praying for guidance on the things I needed to do, I had a distinct impression: go to the Shanghai office of Woori Bank (a Korean bank that was said to be a relatively safe place to park some money in a world where many banks are now close to insolvency) and take out the money I had there in an unusual US dollar account. It wasn't much, but wasn't trivial. I actually wrote that down on my to-do list for that week. I would write it down again for two or three more weeks after that. I came close to going right before our recent trip to Vietnam, but fortunately was able to come up with some very logical reasons about why there was no need to do that. I would be 6 months before I left China and had plenty of time, and the time I took to do that in January would be time I couldn't do some important things for my work, my callings, whatever. It just made no sense, and I provided persuasive reasons why I could delay that prompting. No rebuttal. God walked away. Bingo, I won! Such an easy victory. (I say that with all due respect.) I had similar victories as I was packing and preparing for our short trip to Vietnam almost a month ago. I was repeatedly prompted to bring my journal, to bring a backup hard disk, to bring extra cash, to bring a an unnecessarily large supply of medication, and most strangely of all, to bring some of my collection of magic tricks that I use daily when I am around my grandchildren. My arguments were to the point and overwhelmingly persuasive: ""There's no way I'm going to be doing magic tricks for Vietnamese kids. There's no need for extra cash in Vietnam and it could be stolen. I need to travel light, so my heavy journal will be a burden that I can deal with after my short trip. And bringing my backup disk puts me at risk of having it and my computer stolen while traveling -- a disaster."" God just didn't have any reply to such persuasiveness. Victory, victory, victory! So sweet. On the other hand , now that the Corona virus has swept across China and made it impossible or unwise to return home to Shanghai after my short trip to Vietnam, causing my wife and I to flee to the US as ""medical refugees,"" where we are now hanging out with family, I can somewhat admit that some of those illogical suggestions might have been slightly useful after all. Since I may not be able to return to China before my visa expires, I may not ever see that money at Woori Bank. I called them yesterday and they explained that for my protection, the only way they will ever let me access the US dollars in my account is to show up at their office in Shanghai with my passport (and visa, of course). The good news, though, is that if I die and my wife can provide proper documentation and evidence of death, she may have a chance of getting some of it if she also goes to China. The helpful employee I reached was chuckling over my situation and the impact of China's and the bank's regulations. Hilarious, I know! My other bank accounts have ATM cards that allow me to withdraw money here in the US, but not that special US dollar account with the appropriately named Woori Bank. The journal, with some precious accounts, would have been nice. The medication would have been useful but I found some more in Vietnam. The hard disk would have been helpful, but I bought another. The magic tricks, well, surprisingly, they would really come in handy now that I am staying much of the time with a family of six grandchildren who are magic addicts and visiting another grandchild in Minnesota tonight who also loves magic. So, grudgingly, I can sort of see some point to some of my Opponent's suggestions, but that doesn't change the fact that I absolutely won the argument -- and lost some valuable resources and time, while gaining some unnecessary worries. I guess winning arguments is not always the best policy when dealing with God. Yes, I'll acknowledge His awesome intelligence, but wish He were a more vigorous debater so it wouldn't always be so easy for me to win. Mercifully, we may have found a way to retrieve the journal and some other much-needed items. I'll report on that story in a few days, which abounds in examples of the great kindness of some foreign and local friends in China who made that possible as an answer to prayer (it was also a rare example of me finally not arguing when there was a good argument to be made against an implausible suggestion). God may not be the best debater by human standards, but He often helps us find second chances or new paths forward after we make major blunders in our lives (sometimes as a result of a very persuasive win in our debates with God). Keep seeking Him and listening to His guidance, in whatever situation you are in. He may have some interesting things for your to-do list, whether it's something small that might help you to bless your neighbor, relieve someone in distress, solve major problems in your life, or prepare to flee your home on your own journey to somewhere unexpected.",0
"Revealing S. Korean studies show antibodies could thwart COVID-19 reinfection, spread","Results from two new South Korean studies shed light on whether antibodies will be a reliable form of protection against COVID-19 for those who have recovered from the disease. SLIDESHOW: Coronavirus outbreak sparks global health emergency In one ongoing study, the Korean Center for Disease Control found that 100% of 25 randomly selected patients who were hospitalized with symptoms and who fully recovered, developed defensive antibodies against COVID-19. Researchers were initially concerned that antibodies might not kill the virus, because roughly half of patients had both antibodies and a current COVID-19 infection. PHOTO: In this March 27, 2020, file photo, a machine dispensing COVID-19 novel coronavirus antigen and antibody diagnostic membrane, on a production line making virus testing kits at the SD Biosensor bio-diagnostic company near Cheongju, South Korea. (Ed Jones/AFP via Getty Images, FILE) More Further investigation, however, suggested that the virus scientists detected might have been dead or so weak that it couldn't infect others. In a second study of more than 10,700 COVID-19 patients, researchers examined 207 individuals who were re-diagnosed with COVID-19 after recovering from their infections. In 39 of those 207 re-diagnosed individuals, researchers did not find any virus replication in patient samples they analyzed. In other words, the new research suggests that if a patient is re-diagnosed with COVID-19 after recovering, it's unlikely he or she will be able to infect others. Still, the KCDC cautioned, it's unclear how long those antibodies last. Until we have that key piece of data, the jury is still out on whether mass immunity is possible.

French Asians hurt by corona-related prejudice,"Doctors and members of the regional government talk outside a hospital in San Sebastian, where the first case of novel coronavirus in the country was confirmed, in La Gomera, Spain, on Sunday. [BORJA SUAREZ/REUTERS] Asian people living in France have taken to social media to complain about the way they have been treated in the wake of the novel coronavirus outbreak. Netizens have used the hashtag JeNeSuisPasUnVirus (I'm not a virus), among others, to complain about having been abused on public transport, on social media, and in the street. The apparent increase in anti-Asian sentiment followed the central France-based newspaper Le Courier Picard using inflammatory headlines that included ""Alerte jaune"" (Yellow alert) and ""Le peril jaune?"" (Yellow peril?), the BBC reported. The broadcaster said there have been similar reports in the United Kingdom and in other countries of an increase in anti-Asian racism. When called out, Le Courier Picard apologized for its headlines and admitted they were examples of the ""worst Asian stereotypes"". Lou Chengwang took to Twitter to tell his neighbors: ""I'm Chinese, but I'm not a virus! I know everyone's scared of the virus but no prejudice, please."" And Cathy Tran used the same hashtag to describe an exchange between two men in the northeastern town of Colmar. She said she heard them say: ""Watch out, a Chinese girl is coming our way."" On another occasion, she said, a man on a scooter told her to wear a face mask. Another social media user said people should ""stop asking if we're dangerous if we cough while all the people around us are doing so"". Reuters reports that customers have frequently asked Pascal Corlier, the owner of a Vietnamese restaurant in Paris, whether any of his serving staff are Chinese. ""There's a sort of unfounded psychosis setting in around the Asian community and Asian food,"" he said, while noting that his takings are about 40 percent down on where they should be. Laetitia Chhiv, who runs an association for young people of Chinese descent, told Reuters: ""We had a student of Chinese origin in Strasbourg who was shouted at by a woman who told him not to touch the avocados she wanted to buy. That was after she asked him where he was from and whether he had the virus."" In Toronto, Canada, concerns about rising anti-Asian sentiment prompted city councilors and Chinese community leaders to call a news conference last week in order to remind residents that people of Asian descent are no more likely to have the virus than anyone else. French-born Sun-Lay Tan, who is of Chinese and Cambodian descent, said: ""Racism against Asians is spreading even faster than the virus. I was sitting on the metro on my way to work and the person next to me edged a few centimeters away and put his scarf over his mouth. I was shocked."" Corlier, the owner of the Vietnamese restaurant in Paris, said ""people are panicking"". He said it is hard to hold that against them. ""But they have to take a step back... and look at the facts."" Meanwhile, several EU nations imposed increased checks at borders on incoming Chinese visitors. Some nations, including Italy, the United States, Australia, have even banned the arrival of visitors from China and introduced a requirement on their own citizens who have visited China to be quarantined upon their return.",0
"In suburban Atlanta, how one city's Main Street navigates COVID-19","Matt Kempner , The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Lost sales and worries about safety, but also some green shoots For the small businesses ringing Main Street in one of metro Atlanta’s tiny downtowns, the last several weeks have been a test of will. Scott Mecredy panicked that the pandemic could shutter his Music On Main Street, or MOMS, launched with money his mother gave him in her dying days. Nikki Fields Scott wondered how she’d pay both her mortgage and rent on Old Town Flowers & Gifts. Jonathan Hillyard agonized over which of his four employees, including a brother and niece, he would furlough first if his video production company, Connext Media, didn’t get more orders soon.  Lilburn’s commercial core is a microcosm of how the coronavirus is pummeling Main Streets around the nation, threatening to flatten businesses and reverse years of downtown revitalization efforts. An antique shop, sports training academy, martial arts studio, special events space, hair salon and Mexican restaurant closed temporarily in Lilburn, where 10 of 11 small business owners interviewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said the pandemic has cut their revenue. Gwinnett County small business owners in downtown Lilburn are wrestling with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. MATT KEMPNER / AJC But the Gwinnett County community of nearly 13,000 residents is also a petri dish of experiments — some successful — as entrepreneurs try to keep their businesses breathing until more customers venture out again. Like the local distillery that switched to making hand sanitizer. Or the farm-to-table restaurant that started selling toilet paper, yeast and bleach. Or the business that, after awful worries, has seen sales surge. Gov. Brian Kemp is moving aggressively to reopen Georgia’s economy. Everything from hair salons and gyms to bowling alleys and tattoo parlors were allowed to reopen Friday after being ordered shuttered in early April. On Monday, restaurants can reopen dining rooms and movie theaters can resume screenings. And a statewide “shelter in space” order for residents is set to expire after Thursday. It’s too early to tell when the state’s Main Streets will fill up again, or if it will be quick enough that some businesses don’t shutter for good. Public health experts are still cautioning Georgians to avoid close human contact. Businesses that are open must maintain safety measures. “One thing I’ve become absolutely convinced of during this pandemic is that I don’t know what is going to happen,” said Betsey Dahlberg, who owns Hope Springs Distillery with her husband and has had to reinvent the business on the fly. Betsey Dahlberg (right) and Paul Allen, owners of Hope Springs Distillery, work to get every drop of hand sanitizer they created into bottles as they prepare their inventory for their customers at their business in downtown Lilburn. (ALYSSA POINTER / ALYSSA.POINTER@AJC.COM) Photo: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Mother’s Day flowers, short on rent, cramped salon For years, Lilburn’s central core lagged other metro Atlanta suburban cities that rebuilt downtowns for a walkable mix of restaurants, quaint shops and homes. More recently, things were looking up. Downtown shop spaces were rented out. The adjacent city park and greenway attracted crowds for Food Truck Tuesdays and free summer concerts. In recent weeks, crews razed the former municipal court building and police station, making room for a possible play fountain, public gathering space and maybe restaurant. The first of more than 50 planned homes are under construction across the street at the Old Town Lilburn project, including plans for a coffee shop and another restaurant. A development for independent older adults is being built nearby. A new development is underway in downtown Lilburn, but pandemic concerns continue to swirl in Lilburn and around metro Atlanta. (ALYSSA POINTER / ALYSSA.POINTER@AJC.COM) Photo: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution The pandemic upturned everything. Events were postponed. Crews fenced off the playground at the city park. Few people strolled by shuttered shops. Electrician Allan Cofer, whose family started in the same shop 56 years ago, saw a sudden dip in jobs. Three doors down, insurance agent Dan White said late payments on policies jumped 20%. Contractor Doug Mauk fretted after several construction projects were postponed, some indefinitely. At Old Town Flowers, Scott said she was forced by a city emergency order to close her shop for two weeks, including during the crucial Easter holidays. Restrictions have since loosened but the 62-year-old owner, who learned the business working in her mom’s flower shop, now makes only deliveries. Nikki Fields Scott, at her Old Town Flowers & Gifts, isn’t ready to reopen the downtown Lilburn store to the public. But she is making deliveries. (ALYSSA POINTER / ALYSSA.POINTER@AJC.COM) Photo: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution She thinks it’s too early to reopen the store, concerned about the virus. She pours a bit of bleach in water for her flowers, hoping that will reduce the risk. She wears a mask and gloves and leaves the flowers outside customers’ doors. Scott’s sales were cut in half in recent weeks as people worried about money and pandemic restrictions slowed demand for flowers at funerals and for people at hospitals and nursing homes. She worries about what will happen next month for Mother’s Day, normally her second busiest time after Valentine’s Day. Her landlord told her to just pay what rent she can for now. Scott said she paid half what she owed. “God blessed me all through the years,” she said. “Even through this he still blesses me, because I am getting orders.” Lilburn has offered deferment of some business taxes, and the Downtown Development Authority excused rent for store owners leasing public property. Hugh Wilkerson, whose wife Rowann owns Antiques in Old Town, helps manage nearby shopping space for another property owner. Four of the five shops there didn’t fully pay last month’s rent, he said, because they had closed during the pandemic. The couple live above their 26-year-old shop on Main Street, in a building that is more than a century old. The shop and its narrow, overflowing aisles closed for more than a month. The couple expect it to survive. Still, “there’s a lot of businesses that probably will never come back,” predicted Wilkerson, who serves on the development authority. Charlotte Kelley, co-owner of 97 Main Salon, said customers kept asking in recent weeks to sneak in a back door to have their hair done or get electrolysis to remove hair, a particularly up close procedure. She declined. She also opposed earlier petitions to allow salons to serve a single customer at a time, worrying about safety and logistics. Now that salons can reopen under Kemp’s order, she’d still rather not, because she remains worried about safety. But she said she will reopen anyway — with numerous protections in place — because her workers need the money and rent is costly. “Financially we have to do it,” Kelley said. Hand sanitizer, flour and 3D videos At Hope Springs Distillery earlier this year, Dahlberg, a former attorney, was busy planning a new rose-flavored gin and an elderflower liqueur with her husband, Paul Allen, a former industrial engineer. Now in their third year of business, they had been ahead of schedule, expecting to break even soon. Instead, with the arrival of COVID-19, sales runs were called off. Bars closed. Their distributor didn’t reorder cases of the distillery’s vodka, gin and absinthe. The couple quickly decided to make alcohol-based hand sanitizer, including giving some to the city police department. Demand boomed for the eight-ounce bottles at $7 a pop. Early on they sparked a traffic jam down Railroad Avenue and around the corner onto Main Street, requiring police officers to direct the flow. Betsey Dahlberg (right) and Paul (center) Allen, owners of Hope Springs Distillery, with Darlene Stokan (left), who purchased four bottles of their hand sanitizer, produced at their distillery in downtown Lilburn. (ALYSSA POINTER / ALYSSA.POINTER@AJC.COM) Photo: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution After 1,500 bottles of sanitizer, the couple is making hundreds more, rationing sales to people who email in advance and get confirmed time slots to stop by. Still, overall sales remain down. “Some nights it is real hard,” she said. “Some nights I say, ‘What the hell.’ A lot of people have worse problems.” Jennifer and Tony Tiberia’s 1910 Public House, a farm-to-table restaurant, had almost no delivery or takeout sales before the pandemic struck. They went from Friday and Saturday nights with typical hour-plus waits to worrying about how they could make payroll, which can hit $65,000 a month between their two restaurants, including Sprig in Decatur. First, they consolidated menus, shortened operating hours and devised more family-oriented meals for takeout. Then they became mini-grocers after realizing customers needed products hard to find in grocery stores but available through restaurant suppliers. Among the offerings: paper towels, latex gloves, flour and uncooked ground beef and chicken breasts. 1910 Public House owners Jennifer (left) and Tony Tiberia pose for a photo inside their restaurant in downtown Lilburn. They’ve had to keep shifting the business to deal with the pandemic and metro Atlantans’ concerns about public gatherings. (ALYSSA POINTER / ALYSSA.POINTER@AJC.COM) Photo: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution The restaurant’s sales are off by 50%, but many staffers are getting shifts again, including former waiters making deliveries. Before the coronavirus, Tiberia had planned to open a coffee shop and another restaurant across Main Street. But she’s having second thoughts, worried that consumers will be slow to return to eating near strangers. While Kemp’s order permits the resumption of in-dining, the couple has leaned toward staying focused on takeout, but allowing people who pick up their meals to eat them on an outdoor patio, with no waiter present. Mecredy, who owns MOMS, had to stop holding concerts in his backyard amphitheater. The first show of the season was supposed to be Saturday. It’s unclear when concerts will resume; live entertainment venues still aren’t allowed to reopen. Mecredy, though, who opened his business nine years ago, was stunned that 80% of MOMS students taking music lessons agreed to switch to online classes. That has kept the enterprise afloat. Scott Mecredy, owner of Music on Main Street, poses for a photo outside the business in downtown Lilburn. He was amazed so many parents were willing to try a new way to have their kids stick with music lessons and were anxious to help keep the business afloat. (ALYSSA POINTER / ALYSSA.POINTER@AJC.COM) Photo: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Jonathan Hillyard is one of the few — if not the only — business owners in downtown Lilburn who can claim rising sales amid the pandemic. His three-year-old Connext Media was mostly focused on serving local real estate agents, and he worried he would have to furlough staff. But while some work dried up, Hillyard said he saw an even bigger surge from real estate agents interested in 3D virtual tours of homes. With open houses and showings put on hold, the videos offered prospective homebuyers another way to look inside. Business at his video production company jumped 30% in one month, he said. He knows others haven’t been as fortunate. He said his mother was laid off from a job after 30 years at a home décor showroom inside AmericasMart. She got a week’s severance. His drive to work is also eye-opening. The scene in downtown Lilburn has been “kind of eerie.” For many businesses, he added,“everything is on pause.” In downtown Lilburn, 1910 Public House restaurant server/bartender Greg Thompson prepares a curbside pickup of a customer order: a meal and grocery staples such as toilet paper.

Life in China amid Wuhan Corona Virus.,"Living in China during the Wuhan Corona Virus Pandemic. I was fresh into my internship when my eyes skimmed over some article about the Wuhan Corona virus on my phone and my first reaction was an eye-roll accompanied by a “pfft.” Given the fact I had just survived a bitchy virus of my own, I presumed I could handle whatever was next and powered off my phone. I didn’t take it seriously at all – a contrasting approach from the time of hypervigilance during the swine flu breakout when I would smother myself in hand sanitizer the moment I heard the faintest cough. I knew it was nothing but a medical fad to satisfy people’s absurd apocalyptical fantasies and wanted no part of it. After all, I never got around to watching The Walking Dead so I was nowhere near as enthusiastically freaked out about this apparently deadly virus as others. A few days passed and I continued to walk into my internship, went into some mild coughing fits, and conversed with my colleague about her holiday plans. She mentioned she would go back to her hometown, and upon inquiring where that was, she casually answered Wuhan. “ Cool ” I shrugged before helping myself to another one of her French fries. Yes, those were the peaceful days when there was no segregation between the Wuhanese and the rest. The days when a slight cough would not result in massive public unrest followed by an immediate evacuation of the premises. Yes, those were the days. I was on my way home from my internship one evening when I noticed a sudden emergence of a peculiar fashion trend centered around face-wear: masks. Every where I looked, all I saw were people covered in hideous masks which made me reflexively roll my eyes twenty times. I went on to meet my flatmates for dinner, only to notice they themselves were shivering with worry, saying all sorts of things in their theatrical French accents which helped further dramatize the mood. “ j’you j’know…. Une of our classmates left the countrY due to the err.. the virUs ” said a flatmate who’ll be referred to as Mademoiselle Rossignol. I let out a loud, inelegant laugh which attracted disgusted looks from the waiters, and then I realised I was the only one cackling like a hyena on steroids and everyone else was not amused. “ No way! ” I spat out “ Surely, that’s an overreaction! ” “ j’you… never know…. J’you know 4 pepel already dead! ” chirped Mademoiselle Rossignol in the typical French accent whereby she rose the pitch of her voice towards the end of sentence and, therefore, finished a line about death on a somewhat perky note. “ do j’you know where, err, j’we can buy ,err, masks? ” asked another Frenchie who’ll go by the name of Jean Paul. “ And, err, j’hand sanatIsers! ” added another who we’ll call Croissant. Like an assuring godmother, I calmly told them all that we can set out to buy masks and hand sanitizers together after we finish our dinner, and that’s exactly what we went on to do with me leading the group as I wore an amused expression and tried my best not to giggle at all this ridiculousness. It wasn’t long before we arrived at the nearest health store and I gave my flatmates a smug look as if I was about to perform a cool trick of locating some masks and hand sanatisers and wanted them to applaud when I finally did it. I proceeded into the shop with a determined look and, in a true terminator style, scanned everywhere for these products, but was eventually told by the staff that they were sold out. I paused for a while as it took some time for the words to fully sink in. Sold out?! In the two years that I have been living in China, I never heard the words “sold out” in relation to masks, let alone small bottles of hand-santisers. I felt this to be insanely bizarre but felt comfort knowing we were in the heart of Shanghai which was loaded with shops and commercial centers, so we simply dashed to another store. Also sold out. Then another. Sold out too. Another. Sold out. Every single shop we checked was out of both masks and hand santisers, and this is what launched me into a state of panic. I paused to catch my breath and let myself drink in this situation of doom, like the realization when you took too many caffeine pills and are just waiting for yourself to explode. I saw my flatmates all had tucked their heads in the edges of their top so it could function as a mask. I noticed how the center of Shanghai was rather empty. Those that were around were all wearing masks and anxiously scuttering around. I felt my hands shake… maybe because my phone was vibrating. It was a phone call from Mommajandro. “ THIS IS INTERNATIONAL NEWS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? ARE YOU WEARING A MASK?! ” screamed Mommajandro the moment I answered the call. Mommajando has only one way of communicating with others and that is through shouting. “ they are all sold out… ” “ WHAT SOLD OUT. I TOLD YOU AT THE VERY BEGINNING TO GET MASKS ”. This is one of her classic moves whereby she reinvents the past to support her ‘I told you so’ narrative, when in actuality, she did no such thing. “ You said you don’t even like the idea of wearing masks in public ” “ SHUT UP ” The phone call with Mommajandro only served to make me freak out further and I was fully preparing myself for a heart attack or an epileptic seizure. As soon as I arrived in the apartment with my flatmates, a light bulb went off in my head and I became Jesus, ordering us all a mask through a Chinese takeout app. That was the first time when I began to grasp the severity of the situation and realized I should be more worried than I was at the time. Wuhan Corona Virus Said to have originated in an illegal wildlife market in Wuhan, freaking out over this virus is totally the latest trend! From what I understand, if you cough and have a fever, it’s game over. Or you may just have a common cold as the symptoms of the cold are said to be identical to those of nCOV. This is precisely why when I did a cute little sneeze in the elevator the other day, all the people inside began fidgeting and sweating nervously, desperately hoping the doors would open soon so they could escape. The virus is spreading at an alarming rate and Wuhan is under quarantine, but as the numbers rise, so do worries. People are limiting contact with everyone and everything, abandoning pets and in some cases, children. The Current Situation Right now, it’s as if I am trapped in a high-rise tower like Rapunzel in the modern, apocalyptic version of Disney’s Tangled. Mommajandro had taken the role of Mother Gothel as she would scream warnings through the phone every morning to ensure I do not leave the apartment. On top of that, there are the spam messages from the university which are also in-line with Mommjandro’s thoughts. I only occasionally leave the apartment to take my food delivery and even then my fashion-freedom is restricted, thanks to the importance placed on protective clothing over style. This virus has and continues to ruin everything. Let’s start with the fact that I live at the heart of Shanghai – only 10 minutes walk from the bund, and a few minutes from the iconic East Nanjing Road which is equivalent to Times Square in New York — and yet, I can’t enjoy any of it because of this killjoy virus. This level of quarantine wasn’t something that happened overnight where I woke up and just decided it would be fun to trap myself, but it was rather a smooth transition. After our discovery of the mask shortage, I was still chill about going out to eat and meeting friends but I soon realised others didn’t share my way of thinking. The usually bustling downtown area of the city suddenly went full-on silent with only a few people walking by. Even the street vendors who would usually yell at the top of their lungs whenever anyone would pass by, had surprisingly sealed their mouth shut. I would send pictures of dishes at restaurants to friends who, rather than replying with a supportive “Looks yummy!”, would question my sanity that I was still out during this time and tell me to go home or to the nearest mental institution. The subways were quiet with only a few people there, mostly staff workers and old people who clearly did not fear death. There was a time when an unmasked guy approached me and began speaking, resulting in me panicking and running away, only to look back and notice the guy was chasing after me. There was a time when I was strolling around with music in my ear phones, looking for a restaurant, and then a song came on with lyrics as follows: I am walking in the wrong lane to a place unknown My head is filled with you, I am in my comfort zone But when I ring your bell, I see you’ve left me alone. Where are you? I am wondering what to do? I am missing you, try to call your phone but you left me in the cold. THE STREETS ARE LONELY!! ! THE DARKNESS CLOSING IN ON ME. I AM JUST CIRCLING AROUND…. AROUND AND AROUND…. The timing of the song couldn’t be more befitting to the situation at the time because it turns out that while I was looking for a restaurant to eat, I was actually circling around and around the same area. I freaked out, removed my earphones and sought refuge in the nearest restaurant. Then the death tolls continued to rise. More messages came in. And phone calls. And rumours. All of these little things added up and skyrocketed my blood pressure, leading me to eventually make the final decision of putting myself under quarantine. Others’ take on the Situation This pandemic has incited varying responses from different types of people, ranging from not leaving the room to leaving the entire country. Let’s start with Renée. If you read the previous blog-post regarding my travels with Renée, you would know she is someone deeply cherished by Jesus due to her unbelievable level of luck that she attributes to her belief in Jesus Christ. And so do I. This leads me to think that while everyone is counting on their own government to make a move, this woman probably has divine protection and Jesus has most likely already granted her full immunity from the virus. Despite this, she has taken strictest of measures in the student dormitory in Suzhou, isolating herself from the student group , rejecting invitations to any parties. I know better than to ignore any advice she has to offer so the moment she told me to get some vodka as a rumoured preventative measure against the virus, I put all my suspicions aside and simply ordered a bottle. May Jesus extend his protection to me too. Other students in my university are leaving the country or have already left and delayed their return to China. My flatmate, Mademoiselle Rossignol, decided to follow the footsteps of her classmate and also get out of the country. She has already booked a flight to sweep her away to France. Despite this, she didn’t want to leave without a final party, holding it in our flat inviting some heavy coughers for a fun night! They probably had the common cold (or so we hope.) Others are also not letting the virus ruin their fun, holding house parties but with some conditions attached. Oksanochka Nëntori Hujati But while most people are taking preventative measures, there is one particular student in our programme who simply refuses to give a fuck, and has taken advantage of the situation to visit all the scenic spots which would usually be crowded if not for the virus. Introducing Oksanochka Nëntori Hujati. As a Chernobyl survivor, Oksanochka Nëntori Hujati has seen it all and remains unfettered, doing all sorts of things during a time when a quarantine is recommended. But oh no. Not for Oksanochka Nëntori Hujati who wants to climb mountains, visit gardens, hop on public buses all the whilst recommending everyone else to stay inside as part of her plan to enjoy everything to herself. Well played, Oksanochka Nëntori Hujati. Pets and Corona Virus A friend by the name of Rosalina invited me over to the apartment she was at because she was looking after a dog for a couple who escaped the country under the pretext of a “holiday”. I didn’t need any convincing because the moment I heard the three-lettered word ‘dog’, was the moment I dashed to the subway ready to make my way over. I have quite a history with these furry fluff balls and my story would put whatever cheesy dog movie to shame anytime, anyday. I am just saying Marley & Me would’ve been a bigger, wider hit rather than the snoozefest it is if I had been the scriptwriter. I am a hard core dog lover and not in a wanting-to-eat kind of way so, naturally, Rosalina’s offer to come by her place and meet the dog was met with a resounding “Yes”, on the basis I wanted to see the dog more than her. We’ll call the dog Rosalina was looking after the typical generic Fluffy . I naturally couldn’t keep my hands off Fluffy and kept drunkenly petting it throughout the night. In some situations my touches became borderline homicidal, and the only reason I didn’t end up killing it was due to how weak I was, but God knows if I “lifted” and “benched”, I would’ve accidentally squeezed the life out of the little thing. Yes, I had oceans of love to offer Fluffy, but sadly, such love was short-lived. The morning after, Rosalina and I went through the usual virus-proofing routine as we strapped on masks before taking beloved Fluffy out for a not-so-relaxing walk. Fluffy seemed like a very responsible dog as he would pee and poo everywhere but then go on to lick the city clean, as if it was his way of apologizing for defecating in some scenic spots earlier. But that was the problem with Fluffy. It was blissfully oblivious to the pandemic, unaware that it was no longer safe to lick everywhere in this virus infested city. Every time he would decide to sweep up some germs with his tongue, I would freeze in fear with eyes bulging out in disbelief. Not only that but this dog had a crazy bladder as he would pee every five seconds, making me think whether this was symptomatic of the corona virus in dogs. When we arrived home, the dog ran up to the sofa and rolled all over it as if it was marking it with it’s scent, leading me to deem the sofa unsafe for human usage before I told Rosalina I could not stay and left immediately. Yeah, yeah. So much for being a “hardcore dog lover” but this story still beats Marley & Me. I was later assured that dogs and cats cannot get this Corona virus but I ain’t risking it. I am sorry, Fluffy. ❤️ Fluffy isn’t alone to being subjected to such cruel behaviour of abandonment (Yes, admittingly by myself). The word is that many disloyal owners are throwing out their pets as they are afraid of catching the corona virus from them, and this has resulted in an uptick in woofs and meows you would hear outside. Recently, me and my flatmates heard a series of meows outside our own flat. Panic ensued when I opened the door and there was cat in the corridor – it somehow made it to the 21 st floor because my flatmates reported seeing it on the ground floor not so long ago. I immediately took action and used an umbrella to poke it into the elevator and sent it back down, much to its dismay. Later, however, when I went outside to take my delivered food, the same cat was there and clung on to me with its potentially infected paws. In a necessary act of animal cruelty, I gently kicked it away but then when it came running back and touched my fucking feet, I was enraged and considered the idea of dropping it off a balcony to end its misery. Yes, the current panicky atmosphere in combination with my lack of respect for cats really led to some terribly dark thoughts. Luckily, I never acted upon that particular idea because an unsuspecting woman came by soon after and the cat, in a desperate attempt to be adopted, went into an elevator with her. Yes, this does seem like a beginning of a horror movie, doesn’t it? Poor woman. At the place of my internship, we also have a cat who is a mega-diva. There was a time when we wanted to take advantage of his cuteness and use him in a greeting card, but he just would not cooperate and threw tantrums left, right, and center before heading into his own automated smart-home. I do hope he stays safe and is not abandoned by our company because my god, that cat is not made for street life. The future ahead – or the lack of. Are you scared? I am. But not of death – I have reached a point in my life where I welcome death with open arms. But I am scared of dying in a Chinese hospital where there is a huge language barrier, and loved ones not being able to visit for a final goodbye. Death is nothing to worry about. It’s the moments before. But if you gotta go, you gotta go.",0
corona,"Why are the Chinese authorities seemingly ignoring the Wuhan Institute Virology’s contemporaneous coronavirus study (culminating in a Dec. 11, 2019 report, published the day before the outbreak) conducted at the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory, located just 8.6 miles distant from the claimed epicenter of pandemic origin, Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market? Why is the media not reporting this?  Why are most media reports covering the coronavirus still misreporting the source of the virus’ genome sequence as snakes instead of bats?  Since the Wuhan Institute of Virology has already isolated live, novel SARS-like Coronavirus SL-CoV-WIV1 from bat droppings in 2016, and such virus has been confirmed to invade the host cells through the ACE2 of human beings just like the new, emergent Coronavirus 2019-nCoV — have the two coronaviruses been compared with each other? Was there a vaccine developed from Coronavirus SL-CoV-WIV1 that can be tested on victims of the latest outbreak? After all, it’s been about four years now.  Has any formal investigation been launched into any role the Wuhan Institute of Virology (and specifically, its Classification P4 Biosafety Laboratory) may have played in the pandemic outbreak?  Did the new coronavirus penetrate the biosecurity measures of Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory? Did some bats mount a successful escape?  Did any scientists, researchers, professors, observers, students, or other staff persons working at or visiting the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory visit the Huanan Seafood Market in the first twelve days of December, 2019?  Since the original technology for viral confinement at the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory was developed in France, and since most of its actual, functional equipment was imported from France — has the laboratory received ongoing certification inspections from French officials, given its lengthy, ongoing activities using Class 4 pathogens (P4) — the most virulent viruses that pose the highest risk of aerosol-transmitted person-to-person infections? If so, where are the certification test results?  Has the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory been regularly inspected and audited by Chinese government health officials, especially by Li Bin, minister of the National Health and Family Planning Commission? If so, where are the inspection and audit results?  Could there have been either a staff person or visitor who smuggled out the coronavirus from the laboratory? (After all, a Chinese national was just arrested at Harvard University for attempting to smuggle research vials back to China at the same time when the Coronavirus 2019-nCoV outbreak started.)  At any time did Prof. Zhengli Shi — who simultaneously currently holds the multiple titles of Senior Scientist and Principal Investigator, Director of the Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases, Director of BSL-3 Labatory, Director of the Committee of Biosafety, Director of Chinese Academy Sciences (CAS) Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, and Vice Director of BSL-4 Laboratory at Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS — ever work directly or indirectly for the CCP military services or military intelligence community?  Did Prof. Zhengli previously or does she currently co-conduct, coparticipate, collaborate, or collude with CCP military service members or military intelligence members?  Do members of the CCP military services or military intelligence contribute or participate in any manner or conduct viral research at the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory?  Did Prof. Zhengli or any other faculty member at the Wuhan Institute of Virology take possession, either illicitly or officially, of any biological substance, whether pathogen, vaccine, or other biomatter, originating from the United States or Canada?  Why did the US National Institute of Health (NIH) grant Prof. Zhengli $665,000 in 2014 to fund her study, The ecology of bat coronaviruses and the risk of future coronavirus emergence? What did the US receive in return?  Why did the United States Agency of International Development grant Prof. Zhengli $559,500 to fund her study, Emerging Pandemic Threats PREDICT 2_China? What did the US receive in return?  Why did Prof. Zhengli receive funding from U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency (the agency which deals specifically with Weapons of Mass Destruction), the U.S. Biological Defense Research Directorate of the Naval Medical Research Center, and the Department of Atomic of the Government of India?  What other professional relationships with U.S. defense agencies does Prof. Zhengli have currently, or previously, in any capacity?  When Prof. Zhengli received a visa to the United States to present at the Cell Symposium: Emerging and Re-emerging Viruses 2017 conference in Arlington, Virginia, did she visit the Pentagon or meet with Pentagon officials, since it was less than a mile away?  When Prof. Zhengli received a visa to the United States to present at the US-China Workshop on Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases conference at UC Berkeley in 2018, did she visit Federal research facility, Lawrence-Berkeley-Livermore Laboratory — in particular, the Department of Energy’s Joint Genome Institute — or meet with government officials, since it was only a mile and a half away?  Prof. Zhengli’s C.V. indicates she received a visa to the United States to present at the U.S.-China Dialogue on the Challenges of Emerging Infections, Laboratory Safety and Global Health Security conference on January 17, 2018, in Galveston, Texas. However, such a conference appears to not have existed. For what purpose did she really come to Galveston — perhaps to visit the Galveston National Laboratory, a high security National Biocontainment Laboratory housing several Biosafety Level 4 research laboratories, one of the only 15 biosecurity Level 4 facilities in the United States and the largest one in the world located on an academic campus? Was this apparently imaginary conference merely a ruse for a surreptitious rendezvous?  Of Prof. Zhengli’s 130 published scientific studies, 5 of them are not to be found anywhere. Why are they not public? Are they classified?  Has Prof. Zhengli (or any other staff, resident or guest scientists, researchers, students, visitors, or others) at the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory, or at Wuhan Institute of Virology in general, collaborated, participated with, colluded with, or in any way professionally acted in concert or collusion with, or in any way worked with or for, the World Economic Forum, the U.S. Center for Disease Control, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Pilbright Institute, the European Commission, the World Health Organization, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, or the John Hopkins Center for Health Security?  Prof. Zhengli recently (January 23, 2020) claimed to know very little about the latest epidemic outbreak, including basic biology, animal source, or any specific treatment, and indicated she doesn’t know if ACE2 targeting drugs could treat Coronavirus 2019-nCoV infected victims. How can this be the case, given that she has studied human ACE2/coronavirus interaction for many years — even most recently in her study immediately preceding the outbreak — as reported in Prof. Zhengli’s study published the day immediately preceding the outbreak? “The full-length genes of MERS-CoV spike (GenBank accession number 415 AFS88936.1), SARS-CoV spike (GenBank accession number AFR58742), human DPP4 416 (GenBank accession number NM_001935.3) and human ACE2 (GenBank accession 417 number NM_021804) were synthesized (GenScript Biotech).”  Considering Prof. Zhengli is the recipient of millions of dollars in grants and salaries, commands one of the world’s leading, most advanced biosafety laboratories, has performed innumerable research studies into coronaviruses for three decades and counting — what vaccines, to date, has she successfully produced? Has she produced any successful coronavirus vaccines at all? If so, where are they and how have they been publicly administered?",0
"The Corona Virus and the PLAGUE OF CORRUPTION - ""Boy, Do I Hate Being Right All the Time!""","WE NEED TO STOP EXPERIMENTING ON VIRUSES IN ANIMAL AND HUMAN TISSUE. REGARDLESS OF YOUR INTENTIONS, YOU ARE CREATING MONSTERS WHICH CAN DEVASTATE THE HUMAN RACE AND YOU CAN NEVER CONTROL THEM. THEY WILL BREAK FREE. I'm not sure how I can state it more clearly. Yes, that makes me an Anti-Vaxxer, but it also makes me somebody who claims we need to SHUT-DOWN this type of research immediately. Let me review some of the media reports and posts by experts which have led me to this conclusion. The Washington Times had an article from January 27, 2020 entitled "" China Silent Amid Growing Doubts Over Corona-Virus Origins."" Here are a couple samples from that article: ""China's government stood silent Monday in the face of growing scientific reports that the source of the deadly Wuhan virus outbreak did not originate solely from a seafood market in the city . . . Suspicions about a link to a biological warfare leak in Wuhan have been raised because the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory handles deadly viruses and its civilian and military research are intertwined in China . . . The State Department said in a report last year that is suspects China is working covertly on offensive biological weapons . . ."" The article is saying that the alleged ""bat soup"" origin of the virus from the local seafood market is shaky, at best. But guess what??? You should know that the scientists in Wuhan were studying bats and corona viruses because the immune system of bats seems to be able to suppress the virus. What an amazing coincidence! Zero Hedge published an article on February 1, ""Corona Virus Contains 'HIV insertions,' Stoking Fears Over Artificially Created Bioweapon.""",0
Corona Virus Preventive Homeopathic Medicines,"First things first, just to remind everybody this is a VIRUS, not a bacterial infection. Viruses only respond to our immune system, so taking an unnecessary course of antibiotics WILL NOT help, but can actually harm - as antibiotics can lower your immune response by affecting the stomach! The following tips are also helpful as the world enters the (normal) flu season!! Start taking: High levels of Vitamin C – FOODS HIGH IN VIT C – Thyme, cabbage, parsley, onions, lemons, limes, and oranges. ZINC -FOODS HIGH IN ZINC – Ginger, Pumpkin Seeds, Lentils. Vitamin D3 - get out into the sun!! Probiotics (multi-strain) – Manuka Honey – 2 tsp a day – one teaspoon in the morning and one teaspoon at night. Essential oils - EOs are excellent to start burning in your room and in your homes!! Our first point of contact for viruses is our nose. If you are burning antiviral essential oils around you this will kill off the virus before it enters your system.",0
China's corona virus disease could have same death rate as Spanish flu pandemic that killed 50m people,"China's corona virus disease could have same death rate as Spanish flu pandemic that killed 50m people Alexandra Thompson Concern in China as coronavirus death toll rises. China’s deadly coronavirus may have the same death rate as Spanish flu, an expert has warned. Deaths from the new virus rose to 17 on Wednesday with hundreds of cases now confirmed, increasing fears of widespread contagion. The Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 is widely regarded as “the deadliest in history”, and is believed to have infected around 500 million people worldwide, killing between 20 and 50 million. View photos The new coronavirus strain has caused 17 confirmed deaths so far. [Photo: Getty]More READ MORE: What is the mystery illness affecting China? Chinese officials have confirmed 440 cases of the new coronavirus strain - 2019-nCoV - so far, with 17 deaths. Based on existing data, the disease is said to have a 2% death rate. This means that for every 50 people who catch the infection, one will statistically die. To put this into context, around one in every 1,000 who develop flu die, giving it a death rate of 0.1%. “This [2019-nCoV’s death rate] could be 2%, similar to Spanish flu,” said Professor Neil Ferguson from Imperial College London. View photos Patients with pneumonia caused by the new strain of coronavirus are being treated in Jinyintan hospital, in Wuhan. (Reuters)More Professor Peter Horby from the University of Oxford pointed out that fatality estimations are based on “clinical data around hospital cases”. Of those in hospital, “15%-to-20% are severe cases”, defined as needing ventilation. Coronaviruses as a class are common, causing everything from the common cold to epidemics like severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). 2019-nCoV is thought to have originated in animals before “jumping” over to humans. “Novel viruses spread much faster because we have no immunity,” Prof Ferguson said.

(AP Photo/Tatan Syuflana)More Fatalities are occurring as a result of pneumonia, which comes about when a respiratory infection causes the alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs to become inflamed and filled with fluid or pus, according to the American Lung Association. The lungs then struggle to draw in air, resulting in reduced oxygen in the bloodstream. “Without treatment the end is inevitable,” said the charity Médecins Sans Frontières. “Deaths occurs because of asphyxiation.” The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned there is no specific treatment for coronaviruses If the infection triggers pneumonia, doctors work to combat the complication. When a virus is to blame – like 2019-nCoV – pneumonia may be treated via “antiviral medication”, according to the American Lung Association. Yet, Prof Horby argued there is “no effective anti-viral”. “Most pneumonia is bacterial,” he said. These infections tend to respond to antibiotics.",0
Condition of Corona-infected nurses improves,"The condition of two nurses — a Filipino and an Indian — who tested positive for MERS-Coronavirus at a hospital in Abha has improved. “I spoke to the Indian nurse over phone to reassure her health,” said Indian Consul General Mohammed Noor Rahman Sheikh. Speaking to Saudi Gazette, he said that the Indian Consulate authorities are in constant touch with the director of health affairs and other officials in Asir region who have taken all the precautionary measures to contain the spread of the virus. The nurse who has infected with the virus hails from Ettumanoor in Kottayam district of the southern Indian state of Kerala. She reportedly contracted the virus while caring for a nurse from the Philippines, who had tested positive for MERS. Sheikh said that the nurse is among some 50 Indian nurses working at Al-Hayat Hospital in Khamis Mushayt and she has been shifted to the corona center of Asir Central Hospital following the infection. “We have received information that no other nurses had contracted the virus and that Prince Turki Bin Talal, emir of Asir, has given necessary instructions to take all measures to contain the spread of the disease,” the consul general said. Ashraf Kuttichal, president of the southern region committee of Overseas Indian Cultural Congress and member of the Indian Consulate Welfare Committee, told Saudi Gazette that the nurse has been shifted to hospital ward from the intensive care unit after her condition improved considerably. Dr. Tareq Al-Azraqi, consultant internist at Asir Central Hospital and head of the infection control committee in the southern region, informed that the condition of the Filipino and Indian nurses have improved to the extent that there is no cause for concern. Around 150 staff members of Al-Hayat Hospital, mostly expatriate nurses, have already tested negative for the virus while the procedures are under way to carry out tests of the remaining 85 staffers, Kuttichal said quoting the health department officials. The social worker said around 30 nurses from Kerala were quarantined at their accommodation for some time after one of their inmates had tested positive for Coronavirus on Jan. 21. “The nurse had been caring for their Filipino colleague, a chronic patient who later tested positive for the virus,” he said. V. Muraleedharan, India’s minister of state for foreign affairs, tweeted on Thursday that about 100 Indian nurses working at Al-Hayat Hospital have been tested and none except one nurse was found infected by Corona virus. “The affected nurse is being treated at Asir Central Hospital and is recovering well,” he said. Meanwhile, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has written to the Ministry of External Affairs, seeking intervention in connection with the MERS-coronavirus outbreak among the nurses. In a letter sent to S. Jaishankar, India’s minister of external affairs, he urged to take the matter seriously and ensure better treatment after communicating with the Saudi authorities.",0
"On the Origins of the 2019-nCoV Virus, Wuhan, China","RECOMBINATION technology has been in use in molecular virology since the 1980’s. The structure of the 2019-NCoV virus genome provides a very strong clue on the likely origin of the virus. Unlike other related coronaviruses, the 2019-nCoV virus has a unique sequence about 1,378 bp (nucleotide base pairs) long that is not found in related coronaviruses. Looking at the phylogenetic tree recently published derived using all the full genome sequence, we see the 2019-nCoV virus does not have clear monophyletic support given the bootstrap value of 75 (Fig 1). Close-up on Bootstrap value of 75 for available 2019-nCoV from Lu et al., 2020 The Lancet article [ Full Text ] There is no doubt that there is a novel sequence in 2019-nCoV; we confirmed this via sequence alignment. Here’s the DOT plot: The gap in the line shows a lack of sequence homology beween the most similar bat coronavirus and 2019-nCoV. The inserted sequence, which should not be there is here: inserted-portion Download A database search by the first team to study and publish the whole genome sequence for the origins of the inserted sequence turned up no hits (Ji et al., 2020). They conducted a codon-bias analysis which led them to speculate that perhaps there had been a recombination event between a coronavirus in snakes with a coronavirus from bats (Ji et al., 2020). [ Full Text ] This led to criticism on Wired(3) with quote dismissing the snake origin hypothesis as lacking evidence. There is, however, clear evidence that the novel sequence, which I will refer to henceforth as INS1378, is from a laboratory-induced recombination event. Specifically, (1) The sequence similarity to other coronavirus sequences is lower to its most similar sequences in any coronavirus than the rest of the genome (IPAK finding) (2) The high sequence similarity of INS1378 to a SARS spike protein (2; IPAK Confirmed) . (3) We also found significant sequence similarity of INS1378 to a pShuttle-SN vector that was in use in the 1980’s in China to create a more immunogenic coronavirus (IPAK finding, details below, Option 4). Here, I review four Option on the origins of the 2019-nCoV Coronavirus isolated from human patients from Wuhan, China. Option 1. Natural coronavirus related to bat coronaviruses, Not a Recombined Virus . Evidence for: Phylogenetic clustering with Bat coronaviruses. Evidence against: Low bootstrap support (N=75) and presence of a INS1378. Status: Falsified hypothesis. Test: Survey coronviruses in animals in the wild. Option 2. A recombined virus that naturally picked up a SARS-like spike protein in it N-terminus (3′ end) of the viral genome. Evidence for: The INS1378 codon bias similar to snakes ($) Evidence against: Insufficient match in database search to other known CoV spike proteins (Ji et al., 2020) Status: Speculative hypothesis. Unlikely. Test: Find an isolate that matches 2019-nCoV in the wild and reproducibly independently isolate the virus from a wild animal (a match will confirm). Option 3. A recombined virus made in a laboratory for the purpose of creating a bioweapon. Both China and the US hinted at the other side’s potential liability in playing a role in bringing about a novel coronavirus in the lab specifically for the purpose of being used as a bioweapon. To add to the intrigue, a Chinese Scientist was released from BSL-4 laboratory in Manitoba, Canada for violating protocols, allegedly sending samples of deadly viruses to mainland China. On January 26, The Washington Times published this article citing an Israeli defense expert claiming that China has likely proceeded with a bioweapons program, but ending the article with a quote to London’s Daily Mail from a US scientist Rutgers University microbiologist Richard Ebright that “at this point there’s no reason to harbor suspicions” that the lab may be linked to the virus outbreak. The same person was quoted in a Feb 2017 Nature article stating that SARS had escaped the Wuhan facility “multiple times”. Evidence for: Presence of BSL-4 laboratory 20 miles from the Wuhan seafood market Evidence against: Published opinion. Status: Rumor. But see below. Option 4. A recombined virus made in a laboratory for the purpose of creating a vaccine. IPAK researchers found a sequence similarity between a pShuttle-SN recombination vector sequence and INS1378. Here’s a shot of the alignment and the DOT Plot. Here’s the nucleotide sequence at NCBI’s Nucleotide database . Here’s a patent for its use in recombination virology. The pShuttle-SN vector was among many described in a 1998 paper by Bert Vogelstein et al; here is a company where one can purchase the pShuttle-SN vector: It turns out that the sequence from pShuttle is most closely related to the Spike protein from SARS coronavirus. This particular technology was used in 2008 to attempt to develop a more immunogenic vaccine against coronavirus. Here’s a Chinese patent for that technique and product intended for use in a vaccine . The patent summary reads: SARS vaccine of adenovirus vector and preparation method, application of coronavirus S gene Abstract (translated from Chinese) The present invention belongs to the field of genetic engineering, particularly relates to adenoviral vector SARS vaccines, their preparation and coronavirus S genes in SARS (SARS) on vaccines for the prophylaxis. By means of biological engineering, the coronavirus S gene in combination with deficient recombinant adenovirus, the protective immunogen protein or polypeptide expressed therein, through expansion culture, purification, and formulation to prepare a mucosal immunogenicity can cause the gene vaccine, respiratory mucosal immune response induced by the body to produce antibodies against the virus infection. Specific conditions of the present invention, compared with conventional inactivated virus particle vaccine, safe, easy to use, without limitation intramuscular, have broad clinical applications. In 2015, The US called for an end to research creating new viruses in the lab that have increased threat (higher transmissibility, higher pathogenicity, higher lethalithy) (3) The very researchers conducting studies on SARS vaccines have cautioned repeatedly against human trials; “An early concern for application of a SARS-CoV vaccine was the experience with other coronavirus infections which induced enhanced disease and immunopathology in animals when challenged with infectious virus [31], a concern reinforced by the report that animals given an alum adjuvanted SARS vaccine and subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV exhibited an immunopathologic lung reaction reminiscent of that described for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants and in animal models given RSV vaccine and challenged naturally (infants) or artificially (animals) with RSV [32], [33]. We and others described a similar immunopathologic reaction in mice vaccinated with a SARS-CoV vaccine and subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV [18], [20], [21], [28]. It has been proposed that the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV is the antigen to which the immunopathologic reaction is directed [18], [21]. Thus, concern for proceeding to humans with candidate SARS-CoV vaccines emerged from these various observations.” – Tseng et al., The disease progression in of 2019-nCoV is consistent with those seen in animals and humans vaccinated against SARS and then challenged with re-infection. Thus, the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV is an experimental vaccine type must be seriously considered. Evidence for: Sequence homology between INS1378 to pShuttle Coronavirus vaccine; presence of a SARS-like Spike protein in bat coronavirus, otherwise most similar to bat coronaviruses; low bootstrap value. Evidence against: Low sequence homology (but highly signifiant). NB these viruses are RNA viruses and they can evolve quickly, even under laboratory conditions. Status: Most likely. Test: Determine the nucleotide sequence all laboratory types of coronavirus being studied in China (a match will confirm). Find an isolate that matches 2019-nCoV in the wild and reproducibly independently isolate the virus from a wild animal (a match will falsify). The available evidence most strongly supports that the 2019-NCoV virus is a vaccine strain of coronavirus either accidentally released from a laboratory accident, perhaps a laboratory researcher becoming infected with the virus while conducting animal experiments, or the Chinese were performing clinical studies of a Coronavirus vaccine in humans. Dr. Dale Brown brought to my attention the studies that have reported serious immunopathology in animals – rats, ferrets, and monkeys – in which animals vaccinated against coronoviruses tended to have extremely high rates of respiratory failure upon subsequent exposure in the study when challenged with the wild-type coronavirus. “Caution in proceeding to application of a SARS-CoV vaccine in humans is indicated”- Te et al., 2012 [ Full Text ] Yasui et al., (2012) reported severe pneumonia in mice who were vaccinated against SARS who were subsequently infected with SARS. Another study of a double-inactived SARS vaccine found increased eosinophilic proinflammatory responses in vaccinated mice, especially older mice, writing: “Importantly, aged animals displayed increased eosinophilic immune pathology in the lungs and were not protected against significant virus replication.” If the Chinese government has been conducting human trials against SARS. MERS, or other coronviruses using recombined viruses, they may have made their citizens far more susceptible to acute respiratory distress syndrome upon infection with 2019-nCoV coronavirus. The implications are clear: if China sensitized their population via a SARS vaccine, and this escaped from a lab, the rest of world has a serious humanitarian urgency to help China, but may not expect as serious an epidemic as might otherwise be expected. In the worst-case scenario, if the vaccination strain is more highly contagious and lethal, 2019-nCoV could become the worst example of vaccine-derived contagious disease in human history. With an uncharacteristic aysmptomatic prodromal period of 5-7 days, individuals returning from China to other countries must be forthright and cooperative in their now-prescribed 2-week quarantine.",0
Spoof: World Health Organization Spread of the Corona Virus,"February 5th, 2020 Well, it’s difficult to know what is real and what is a rumor about the Corona Virus on any given day. The information from the U.S. Communicable Disease Center should be helpful, but it’s not. [Seriously] Included in their statement below are far too many, “Thought to be, CAN and Maybe statements for them to hold up to scientific rigor. [Peer Review] As I started digging further into the subject, it’s very clear that “Those in the Know,” know next to nothing. Fortunately, the CDC shed the light on how the disease is thought to be spread, [Or maybe not] It’s when we hear “The World Health Organization, think the U.N. and they do nothing particularly well.” Much is unknown about how 2019-nCoV, a new coronavirus, spreads. Current knowledge is largely based on what is known about similar coronaviruses. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS , SARS , and now with 2019-nCoV. Most often, spread from person-to-person happens among close contacts (about 6 feet). Person-to-person spread is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. t’s currently unclear if a person can get 2019-nCoV by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. Typically, with most respiratory viruses, people are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest). With 2019-nCoV, however, there have been reports external icon of spread from an infected patient with no symptoms to a clo se contact. It’s important to note that how easily a virus spreads person-to-person can vary. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with 2019-nCoV and investigations are ongoing. This information will further inform the risk assessment . H/T to Jay for the video.",0
Vaxil Announces the Identification of a Potential Corona Virus Vaccine and Provides an Update in the Previously Announced Debt Financing,"VAXIL BIO LTD. ("" Vaxil "" or the "" Company "") (TSX VENTURE: VXL), an innovative immunotherapy biotech company specializing in cancer and infectious diseases, is pleased to announce that it has completed in silico analyses and believes that it has successfully identified a corona virus (COVID-19) vaccine candidate ("" Vaccine Candidate ""). The Vaccine Candidate is based on unique and patent protected signal peptide technology, utilizing Vaxil's proprietary VaxHit™ bioinformatics platform. The Vaccine Candidate's design is also based on successful in vivo experiments testing a tuberculosis signal peptide vaccine. ""We are very excited to have been able to isolate a preliminary candidate that might address the current and emerging need in such a short time,"" said David Goren, Vaxil's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who went on to say that ""we look forward to the next step of identifying resources and partners to solidify the most efficient path forward."" Mr. Goren continued to explain that ""we have identified signal peptide combinations which we believe can be effective as a prophylactic vaccine against the current corona virus and might also demonstrate therapeutic value in the future."" Vaxil plans to initiate non-GMP manufacturing followed by testing as we explore partnerships and other possibilities. Vaxil also wishes to announce that it anticipates that the private placement previously announced on January 20, 2020, pursuant to which the Company will be issuing convertible debentures with a face value of $1,000 and bearing an annual interest rate of 10% for gross proceeds of up to $200,000 will close on or around February 28, 2020. ABOUT VAXIL Vaxil is an Israeli immunotherapy biotech company focused on its novel approach to targeting prominent cancer markers and infectious diseases. Its lead product ImMucin™ successfully completed a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in multiple myeloma and received orphan drug status from the FDA and EMA. The company continues to develop ImMucin™ and is also developing a tuberculosis vaccine / treatment that has demonstrated promising preliminary results with further preclinical evaluation underway at a top US academic and research institution. Additional indications and mAb candidates are under evaluation as immuno-oncology and infectious disease treatments alone and in combination with other treatments. Vaxil exploits the unique properties of signal peptide domains on crucial proteins to develop targeted therapies against cancer targets and infectious disease pathogens. These signal peptide domains are identified by VaxHit™, Vaxil's proprietary bioinformatic approach. These SPs induce a robust T- and B-cell response across wide and varied HLA subtypes, while acting as true, universal neoantigens. The peptide platform targets these cells by ""educating"" or specifically activating the immune system to recognize and attack the affected cells. In addition, Vaxil's mAb platform directly recognizes the target protein expressed on malignant cells and recruits other elements of the immune system to lyse those cells.

Patient tested positive' for 2019 nCOv in Makati Medical Center,"Claim: A message saying a “patient tested positive” for the 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) at the Makati Medical Center circulated on messaging apps and social media platforms on Monday, January 27. The message read: “Hi team, please prevent going to Makati Med. My father-in-law informed us just now that one patient tested positive from Corona Virus (sic). Though naka quarantine na (the patient’s already quarantined)...but still. Also please wear surgical mask at all times most especially whenever we are in Enterprise or Makati area because... ang dami talagang galing china (there really are a lot of people coming from China).” The message continued: “Government banned direct flights from Wuhan but these people enter through different routes just so they would get out of Wuhan. Mala Train To Busan talaga ang dating (The situation is like Train to Busan) . Pati laging mag (Also always use) alcohol after using the elevator. Thanks thanks.” The message came from a certain “Janelle (Zenith),” as indicated at the bottom of the message. Three readers forwarded the message to Rappler for verification. Rappler also spotted at least two Facebook posts that said the same claim. Rating: FALSE The facts: There is still no confirmed case of the 2019 nCoV in the Philippines as of January 28, according to the Department of Health (DOH). However, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said in a press briefing that there are a total of 27 persons under investigation as of 1:30 pm, January 28. Three of them have already been discharged as they tested positive not for 2019-nCoV but for other diseases. The Makati Medical Center reiterated the DOH warning against posting unconfirmed information about the novel coronavirus in a post on its official Facebook account. It was shared at 1:36 pm on January 27, or when the message about an alleged confirmed case started to spread. On January 24, the DOH announced that the 5-year-old boy with a suspected case of the new coronavirus in Cebu City tested negative . Rappler has so far debunked 3 claims since the novel coronavirus outbreak. On January 15, a false claim about a “SARS case” reported in a clinic at Shangri-La Plaza in Mandaluyong City came out. More than a week later, another false claim circulated, that there are “confirmed cases” of coronavirus at the PBCom Tower in Makati. – Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com Keep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.

With the recent Corona Virus outbreak I thought my dream from 2012 certainly fit.,With the recent Corona Virus outbreak I thought my dream from 2012 certainly fit. 11-04-27 Dream: I was walking on top of a grassy ridge. People were all around me. It felt like wartime and I could see soldiers all around us. It felt like Nazi Germany but I knew I was in the US somewhere. Tables were set up with small boxes open on the tables. I heard an air-raid siren wailing close by and the people started running towards the boxes. The boxes held surgical masks. The people were quickly putting them on and running down the hill to the ravine. Pup tents were set up and everyone was piling into them. Sensing the imminent danger I ran to the table grabbed a mask and ran down the hill. I went into the first tent I could find. Several young people were inside the tent panicking. A young girl was crying. We could hear the bombs squealing as they were dropping from the beautiful blue sky. A bomb dropped right beside us and I knew we were doomed. I heard a whirring sound from the bomb and thought it was a dispersant bomb that released some deadly virus or toxin. Some young guy grabbed a defenceless girl and held her up to protect himself from the bomb. What a spineless jerk I thought to myself and I grabbed her and put her behind me trying to protect her from the explosion. I awoke at this point and looked at the clock. It was just after 12am. I remembered the day before during prayer the Lord speaking to me saying by 12 that night he would speak to me concerning the things that are about to come. Posted by Joe Ouellette at 6:26 AM,0
Clover Initiates Development of Recombinant Subunit-Trimer Vaccine for Wuhan Coronavirus (2019-nCoV),"Clover Biopharmaceuticals, a global clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel and transformative biologic therapies, today announced that it has initiated development of a recombinant subunit vaccine for 2019-nCoV, the newly identified coronavirus that is believed to have originated from Wuhan, China. Since this outbreak was first reported in late-2019, the 2019-nCov virus has so far infected thousands of people and has caused over one hundred reported deaths (as of January 28, 2020). The epidemic currently appears to be in an exponential phase. Similar to other enveloped RNA viruses such as HIV, RSV and Influenza, 2019-nCoV is also an RNA virus that has a trimeric spike (S) protein on its viral envelope. The trimeric S protein of 2019-nCoV is responsible for binding to host cell surface receptor ACE2 and subsequent viral entry. Symptoms in infected patients include fever, coughing and breathing difficulties, and it can be fatal. Clover is using its patented Trimer-Tag © technology to construct a recombinant 2019-nCoV S protein subunit-trimer vaccine (S-Trimer) and will produce it via a rapid mammalian cell-culture based expression system. Clover expects to obtain highly purified S-Trimer vaccine for further preclinical safety and analysis within the next 6-8 weeks. Having its own in-house cGMP biomanufacturing capabilities, Clover would potentially be able to rapidly scale-up and produce large-quantities of a coronavirus vaccine, if a successful vaccine candidate is able to be identified. Clover has previously developed recombinant subunit-trimer vaccines for HIV, RSV and Influenza viruses utilizing its Trimer-Tag © technology and has demonstrated that they are able to evoke protective neutralizing antibody responses in multiple animal models. “Upon knowing the genomic DNA sequence of this newly identified 2019-nCoV last week, we immediately started designing the vaccine construct and initiated its gene synthesis. Using our proprietary Trimer-Tag © protein trimerization technology, we plan to complete constructing the expression vector for S-Trimer vaccine and produce it for further evaluation within weeks,” said Dr. Peng Liang, co-founder, Chairman and President of Clover. “We believe that S-Trimer utilizing Trimer-Tag © technology will be faster to produce and potentially safer and more effective than vaccines produced via traditional approaches that involve lengthy live viral propagation, amplification, purification and heat/chemical attenuation or inactivation processes.” “We are excited to initiate development of the S-Trimer vaccine candidate for 2019-nCoV and hope that by leveraging our proprietary Trimer-Tag © technology and cGMP biomanufacturing capabilities, we can help support global efforts to fight the growing 2019-nCoV epidemic,” said Joshua Liang, Chief Strategy Officer and Board Director at Clover. “To this end, we recognize that collaboration will be critical to accelerating the development of a successful vaccine, and we invite any interested regulatory, academic or industry parties to contact and collaborate with us.” About Clover Biopharmaceuticals Clover Biopharmaceuticals is a global, clinical-stage, research-based biotechnology company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing transformative biologic therapies, with a focus on oncology and autoimmune diseases, as well as viral vaccines. Having raised more than US$ 100 million in total capital since 2016, Clover is utilizing its proprietary Trimer-Tag © technology platform to develop novel biologics targeting trimerization-dependent pathways. Additionally, Clover is leveraging its in-house cGMP biomanufacturing capabilities to develop select biosimilars. For more information, please visit our website: www.cloverbiopharma.com . www.cloverbiopharma.com . About Trimer-Tag © Technology Trimer-Tag © is an innovative drug development platform which allows the production of novel, covalently-trimerized fusion proteins. Many major disease targets are trimerization-dependent such as the tumor necrosis factor superfamily (involved in extrinsic apoptosis, immune co-stimulation and inflammation) as well as enveloped RNA virus antigens responsible for entry into host cells. Clover is using Trimer-Tag technology to create trimerized fusion proteins that are able to effectively target these previously undruggable pathways. About Wuhan Coronavirus 2019-nCoV The new coronavirus identified in late-2019 was officially named by WHO as 2019-nCoV on January 12, 2020. Coronavirus is a family of enveloped RNA viruses that include MERS and SARS, both of which caused serious human infections of the respiratory system. 2019-nCoV has never before been found in human and has infected thousands and caused over one hundred deaths (as of January 28, 2020). Currently there are no vaccines or safe and effective treatments available for the virus.",0

"Philippines extends lockdown in Metro Manila, areas with high COVID-19 cases","A soldier wearing a protective mask checks a woman's quarantine pass as the city undergoes a stricter lockdown to contain the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread, in Pasay City, Philippines, April 22, 2020. [Photo/Agencies] MANILA - The Philippine government on Friday announced that a lockdown in Metro Manila and provinces on the main island of Luzon with high number of coronavirus infections will remain in place for another two weeks or until May 15. The Philippine presidential spokesperson Harry Roque made the announcement in a recorded televised address that enhanced community quarantine will remain in Metro Manila, Central Luzon, Calabarzon region comprising the provinces of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon, and Lucena City, and all other areas with high cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) transmission. The entire main Luzon island in the Philippines has been under ""enhanced community quarantine"" from March 16 in a drastic bid to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the country. On April 7 the Philippine government announced that it's going to extend the enhanced community quarantine to April 30 as the government continues to fight COVID-19. The Philippines has so far recorded 6,981 COVID-19 cases with 462 deaths and 722 recoveries.",0
Coronavirus nCOV 2019 - God's Last WarningGod's Last Warning,"The Novel Coronavirus, otherwise known as the Wuhan Coronavirus has taken root in every major country now. It increases at a rate of approximately 1.4x every day. So if you have 10 cases today, you will have 14 tomorrow, 20 the next day, and so on. This is assuming a best case scenario, going off how the virus spread over the last few weeks in China. Unlike most outbreaks, like SARS (also a coronavirus), This one is basically unstoppable, given it’s r0 of approx 3.5-4.7. What do I recommend at this point? Keep yourself informed by subscribing to the channel at the end of this article and watching the video above and the particularly the video below. So far he seems to be one of the few balanced and up to date sources for info on this virus. The only real way to avoid contracting this virus is complete isolation. This is what the government of China has chosen to do based on their data. Rather than repeat the information, I suggest you watch the video below and all his past videos. This is the real deal. I have heard a number of people say, “I will just do nothing and trust in God” based on psalm 91. Now, I absolutely agree if you are taking all available precautions, yes, you can claim those promises, and to avoid panic, I suggest you read it and rest in the promises. However, it is important to note, God is not your fairy god mother. God expects you to do whatever you can, and he will fill the gap of what you can’t do. God will not protect you from traffic if you walk out in front of it. He will not protect you if you intentionally jump off a cliff or play with dangerous snakes in an uncontrolled manner. God uses people to warn you, he gives you options, but you have to take them. Also, you need to pray and listen closely. These events if not prevented by extreme measures, will have a drastic impact on the financial security of the world. It may be a precursor to many of the last day draconian laws that culminate in Sunday laws. However, God knows the future, he knows where you are, and what you can do in your given environment, so you need to pray and use your God given facilities to protect yourself and/or your friends and family. Opposition Be aware, that due to the nature of geometric progression, the virus will appear to move very slowly in your country for the next week or so. You will be called crazy and many different things by friends and family if you take the necessary steps to avoid the virus, just as Noah was. Trust the data, and while panic is useless in this situation, a healthy respect for this dangerous virus is not. A geometric progression will take 67 days to go from 2 to 8 billion cases. Obviously this will slow as people wake up, however, due to the long period of asymptomatic spread of this virus, you don’t have long to act. There are likely far more people infected than is represented by the data. Most importantly get right with God and family members. God is in control, and many will be put in the grave to save them before the end. Any issues you have, get on the phone and try to resolve it where possible. Life is short, and for a significant portion of the population, it just got a lot shorter. So on that note, pray for your friends and family members and stay informed.

President backs Go’s Balik-Probinsya program,"President Rodrigo Duterte is backing the “Balik-Probinsya” proposal of Senator Christopher “Bong” Go’ for the government to provide incentives and livelihood assistance to those in Metro Manila who may want to go back to their provinces once the community quarantine is lifted. During a televised meeting of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases on Friday, the President lauded the proposal which Go himself delivered during the meeting. “What you would give them is hope. Importante yan e — yung that if they go there some of them might really leave the city of Manila with a heavy heart but we have to provide the transportation at sabihin natin if you go back ganito ganito.” “What is really very important is we give them hope,” the President said. Go’s proposal aims to decongest Metro Manila as he said that the lack of urban planning and rural development is one of the factors why COVID-19 cases is spreading fast in the capital. “As soon as the ECQ is lifted and travel is gradually normalize, the government must encourage Filipino families to move out of Manila and other metropolitan areas.” “LGUs (Local Government Units) must also ensure that necessary quarantine measures and mass testing for COVID-19 are in place to prevent those possibly infected from spreading the disease,” Go said. Under Go’s proposal, the government will shoulder the transportation of families who would want to be relocated to provinces. They should also be livelihood assistance. The Senator, who is from Mindanao believes the implementation of the program would result to a more efficient delivery of public goods and services that can benefit all regions. Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez also expressed his support to the program. He suggested that the government provide starting fund for those who would want to start small businesses outside of Metro Manila.",0

Queensland jockey Zoe White has disqualification halved for COVID-19 zoning breach,"For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here. By Adam Pengilly April 24, 2020 — 11.52am A Queensland apprentice jockey who was banned for six months for breaching COVID-19 zoning regulations has had her disqualification halved after an internal review. The Queensland Racing Integrity Commission announced Zoe White, who was told by stewards to self-isolate for 14 days before riding trackwork at Rockhampton, would be on the sidelines for only three months. Jockeys have been subject to strict coronavirus protocols to keep the industry going. Credit: AAP Her penalty will expire on July 2. It was the biggest sanction handed down to a horse-racing participant since the industry implemented its coronavirus guidelines, which include segregating jockeys into riding pools across the country. Advertisement White was told to quarantine herself from March 30, but attended trackwork two days later. Loading Racing NSW stewards banned Gai Waterhouse's loyal lieutenant Neil Paine from race meetings for a month after he sprinted across the mounting yard and embraced Waterhouse's co-trainer Adrian Bott following Farnan's record-breaking Golden Slipper win. English jockey Tom Marquand was also fined $2000 for hugging Addeybb's strapper Safid Alam after the horse cleared away to win the Queen Elizabeth Stakes on the second day of The Championships. Alam was hit with a $500 fine. Thoroughbred racing is the only sport to have continued in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic, except in Tasmania where it was shut down by the government.",0

Are Melting Icecaps Bringing Corona Virus to Life?,"Could there be a link between climate change and corona virus outbreak? Melting ice caps are releasing some viruses that were lying frozen and dormant for ages. The warming temperatures have stirred them to life and they have woken up with a vengeance. Corona virus could be one of them, they say. It has so far taken 362 lives and laid sick more than 14,000 people. The viruses attack the species lower in the food chain. Insects, animals and birds have immunity much lower than humans, hence are the first to catch the virus. Humans that come in contact with such animals get infected. Scientists have known all along that infectious disease transmission patterns are likely to be a major consequence of climate change. To back it with evidence, work is on at World Health Organisation to study the underlying relationship. Results of these studies will help predict future impacts, using better validated models. Instead of panicking, scientists say, it is better to take the necessary precautions as there is no known cure for corona virus yet. Places that have high temperatures are safer as the heat will kill the virus, scientists say, giving a ray of hope in an alarming scenario. Frequently clean hands by using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water; When coughing and sneezing cover mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue – throw tissue away immediately and wash hands; Avoid close contact with anyone who has fever and cough; If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early and share previous travel history with your health care provider; When visiting live markets in areas currently experiencing cases of novel coronavirus, avoid direct unprotected contact with live animals and surfaces in contact with animals; The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided. Raw meat, milk or animal organs should be handled with care, to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods, as per good food safety practices.",0

Clover Successfully Produced 2019-nCoV Subunit Vaccine Candidate and Detected Cross-Reacting Antibodies from Sera of Multiple Infected Patients,"Clover Biopharmaceuticals , a global clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel and transformative biologic therapies, announced today that it has successfully produced its trimeric Spike-protein (“S-Trimer”) subunit vaccine candidate for 2019-nCoV via a mammalian cell expression system. In addition, Clover scientists have used the newly obtained S-Trimer and successfully detected antigen-specific antibody in sera from multiple fully recovered patients who were previously infected by the virus. Importantly, Clover is the first company in the world to disclose a 2019-nCoV vaccine candidate that can successfully be recognized by antibodies produced by previously-infected patients, supporting that S-Trimer has preserved the native structure of the viral spike (S) protein and thus may elicit a protective-immune response as a vaccine. This work was carried out with the support of leadership teams from Chengdu Hi-Tech Park and Chengdu Clinical Center for Public Health in China. Similar to other enveloped RNA viruses such as HIV, RSV and Influenza, 2019-nCoV is also an RNA virus that has a trimeric spike (S) protein on its viral envelope. The trimeric S protein of 2019-nCoV is responsible for binding to host cell surface receptor ACE2 and subsequent viral entry. Symptoms in infected patients include fever, coughing and breathing difficulties, and it can be fatal. Upon knowing the genomic DNA sequence of this newly identified 2019-nCoV last month, Clover scientists immediately started designing the viral S-protein construct and completed its gene synthesis. Utilizing our patented Trimer-Tag © technology, Clover has produced a S-Trimer subunit vaccine that resembles the native trimeric viral spike via a rapid mammalian cell-culture based expression system. Having one of the largest in-house, commercial-scale cGMP biomanufacturing capabilities in China, Clover could potentially be able to rapidly scale-up and produce large-quantities of a new coronavirus vaccine. Clover has previously developed recombinant subunit-Trimer vaccines for RSV and Influenza viruses utilizing its Trimer-Tag © technology and has demonstrated that they are able to evoke protective neutralizing antibody responses in multiple animal models. “I am very excited that Clover has achieved high-level expression of the native-like trimeric viral Spike protein (S-Trimer) in mammalian cells in record time, and importantly, we have used the newly-obtained vaccine candidate to successfully detect viral S protein-specific antibodies from the sera of multiple patients who recently recovered from 2019-nCoV infection in China. The implication of this discovery is that it not only has validated the correct conformation of our S-Trimer subunit vaccine candidate, but also further supports that the new 2019-nCov virus is indeed the culprit for the current epidemic, since all previous diagnosis for the viral infections have been based on nucleic acid detection. This important finding forms a solid foundation for the continued rapid development of S-Trimer vaccine through pilot production, preclinical efficacy and safety studies, followed by human clinical trials and subsequent large-scale production.” said Dr. Peng Liang, co-founder, Chairman and President of Clover. “We remain confident that Clover can be among one of the first companies to develop a successful vaccine to contain the 2019-nCoV epidemic, as well as any future outbreaks of similar coronaviruses”. “We are encouraged by the rapid progress of our S-Trimer vaccine development for 2019-nCoV and hope to support global efforts in fighting this epidemic,” said Joshua Liang, Chief Strategy Officer and Board Director at Clover. “To this end, we recognize that collaborations will be critical to accelerating the development of a successful new vaccine in times of emergency, and we invite any interested regulatory, academic or industry parties to contact us for this noble common cause.” About Clover Biopharmaceuticals Clover Biopharmaceuticals is a global, clinical-stage, research-based biotechnology company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing transformative biologic therapies, with a focus on oncology and autoimmune diseases, as well as viral vaccines. Having raised more than US$ 100 million in total capital since 2016, Clover is utilizing its proprietary Trimer-Tag © technology platform to develop novel biologics targeting trimerization-dependent pathways. Additionally, Clover is leveraging its in-house cGMP biomanufacturing capabilities to develop select biosimilars. For more information, please visit our website: www.cloverbiopharma.com . www.cloverbiopharma.com . About Trimer-Tag © Technology Trimer-Tag © is an innovative drug development platform which allows the production of novel, covalently-trimerized fusion proteins. Many major disease targets are trimerization-dependent such as the tumor necrosis factor superfamily (involved in extrinsic apoptosis, immune co-stimulation and inflammation) as well as enveloped RNA virus antigens responsible for entry into host cells. Clover is using Trimer-Tag technology to create trimerized fusion proteins that are able to effectively target these previously undruggable pathways. About Wuhan Coronavirus 2019-nCoV The new coronavirus identified in late 2019 has been officially named by WHO as 2019-nCoV on January 12, 2020. Coronavirus is a family of enveloped RNA viruses that include MERS and SARS, both of which caused serious human infections of respiratory system. 2019-nCov has never before been found in human, and since this outbreak was first reported in late-2019, the virus has so far infected over 40,000 people and has caused over 900 reported deaths (as of February 9, 2020). It has been declared a Public Health Emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO). Currently there is no vaccine available for the virus.

Corona Virus!,"Hope this helps! Just sharing (from a friend’s friend’s friend )you know how a friend network goes: This is from a doctor in Hong Kong who consulted with his friend (who currently works on SARS prevention research) on some effective ways to prevent the Coronavirus. It was originally written in Cantonese style Chinese so I used my best attempt to translate it into English for you guys. Worth a read. About the virus: 1. It is pretty large in size (cell is about 400-500nm diameter), so any normal mask (not just the N95 feature) should be able to filter it out. However, when someone who’s infected sneezes in front of you, it will take a great 3 meters (about 10 feet) before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne. 2. When the virus drops on metal surface, it will live for at least 12 hours. So remember if you come in contact with any metal surface, wash your hands with soap thoroughly. 3. The virus can remain active on fabric for 6-12 hours. Normal laundry detergent should kill the virus. But if you are really worried, you can add some non-chlorine bleach or oxygen bleach . For winter clothing that does not require daily washing, you can put it out under the sun to kill the virus. About the symptoms of the pneumonia caused by Coronavirus: 1. It will first infect the throat, so the throat will have the dry sore throat feeling which will last for 3 to 4 days 2. Then the virus will blend into the nasal fluid and drips into the trachea and enter the lungs, causing pneumonia. This process will take 5 to 6 days. 3. With pneumonia, comes high fever and difficulty in breathing. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You will feel like you are drowning in water. It’s important to go seek immediate medical attention if you feel like this. About prevention: 1. The most common way of getting infected is by touching things in public, so you must wash your hands frequently. The virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 mins, but a lot can happen in those 5-10 mins (you can rub your eyes or pick your nose unwittingly lol). 2. Aside from washing your hands frequently, you can gargle with Betadine Sore Throat Gargle to eliminate or minimize the germs while they are still in your throat (before dripping down to your lungs).

Corona virus trumps Middle East’s impact on oil prices,"“The Gulf region, and Dubai in particular, is a major travel and business hub between Asia and Europe. Its links with China have been an important part of the region’s development in recent years. As headlines have laid bare the spread of the Wuhan corona virus, global oil prices fell as low as $58.35 a barrel in early trading on 27 January. This steep climb-down, from a high of $68.9 a barrel on 6 January, demonstrates how demand-side considerations in Asia and particularly China – and the threat of a potential pandemic in the region – have risen to the fore. “Coming amid the shutdown of Libyan oil production and a fresh missile attack on the US embassy in Baghdad, the corona virus-linked drop in oil prices illustrates the now perennial under weighting of Middle East risk. “Repeated incidents over the past 12 months have caused only brief spikes in the oil price, with little lasting impact. Despite the geopolitical situation, prices have remained depressed on the back of underlying assumptions about supply and demand conditions. By historic standards, oil prices have stayed low amid the Middle East’s heightened tensions, which have brought the region the closest to open military conflict this side of a decade. “The market response to the health crisis in China is highly reactionary in nature, given that it is not yet clear how deadly the disease will be and what the long-term impacts on the Chinese economy and commodities could be. “Beijing’s measures to curtail the spread of the virus will undoubtedly impact economic activity and growth in the short-term, but it is far more speculative to make assumptions about the longer-term impacts. What has been made overwhelmingly clear, however, is the degree to which oil prices are being driven by demand-side indicators, and the extent to which effects on the Chinese economy in particular are able to influence oil prices over and above destabilising events in the Middle East.”",1

"Some seem to think coronavirus is connected to Corona beer, after spike in Google searches","In late January, when cases of coronavirus were rising, Google Trends reported a spike in searches for ‘beer virus’ and ‘corona beer virus.’  No, the 2019 Novel Coronavirus ( 2019-nCoV ), is not related to the popular refreshing Mexican beer brand called Corona. But that’s not stopping people from searching Google to apparently try to double check. Google Trends released data showing that around late January, there was a marked spike in searches for the terms “beer virus” and “corona beer virus.” Jan. 25 showed the height of the spike in searches for the term “beer virus,” as searches rose to a value of 100 on Google Trends indicating a peak in popularity. For the term “corona beer virus,” it peaked at a value of 81, so searches for that term hit the top of the spike on Jan. 25, but the term was searched a little less often. Connecticut, Oregon and New York searched the term “corona beer virus” the most. Meanwhile, New Mexico, Nebraska and Kansas were in the top three for opting to keep it simple and search “beer virus” the most out of the two choices. Google Trends Worldwide those search terms both hit their peak on Jan. 25 as well according to Google Trends. Searches for the term “beer virus” were highest in the countries of Serbia, Austria and Ireland, Google reported. Searches for the longer “corona beer virus” were highest in South Africa, Portugal and the Netherlands. Google Trends The Miami Herald points out that it might be Google itself leading to the mix up. The search term “corona beer virus” has popped up as the second option in the search engine’s predictive search feature when “corona” was typed into the search field, pointing to a possible cause of confusion.

2019 Wuhan Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV),"Preventative action to help prevent the spread of coronavirus There is currently no vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus. Wash your hands often with soap and water Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands Avoid close contact with people who are sick Stay home when you are sick Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces When visiting live markets in areas currently experiencing cases of novel coronavirus, avoid direct unprotected contact with live animals and surfaces in contact with animals; The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided. Raw meat, milk or animal organs should be handled with care, to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods, as per good food safety practices. How can the virus spread? The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through contact with an infected person through respiratory droplets generated when a person, for example, coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. It is important that everyone practice good respiratory hygiene. How long can the virus survive on the surface? It is still not known how long the 2019-nCoV virus survives on surfaces, although preliminary information suggests the virus may survive a few hours. Simple disinfectants can kill the virus making it no longer possible to infect people. How long is the incubation period? The incubation period is the time between infection and the onset of clinical symptoms of disease. Current estimates of the incubation period range from 2-11 days, and these estimates will be refined as more data become available. Based on information from other coronavirus diseases, such as MERS and SARS, the incubation period of 2019-nCoV could be up to 14 days. Are Antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the 2019-nCoV? No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. The novel coronavirus is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.",1

2019-nCoV Coronavirus Detected in U.S. - First Travel Related Case,"U.S. CDC confirms first case of 2019-nCoV Coronavirus in the state of Washington, U.S.. While severe illness, including illness resulting in several deaths, has been reported in China, other patients have had milder illness and been discharged. Symptoms associated with this virus have included fever, cough and trouble breathing. This is a rapidly evolving situation. CDC will continue to update the public as circumstances warrant. Main Digest The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the first case of in the United States in the state of Washington. The patient recently returned from Wuhan, China, where an outbreak of pneumonia caused by this novel coronavirus has been ongoing since December 2019. While originally thought to be spreading from animal-to-person, there are growing indications that limited person-to-person spread is happening. It's unclear how easily this virus patient from Washington with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection returned to the United States from Wuhan on January 15, 2020. The patient sought care at a medical facility in the state of Washington, where the patient was treated for the illness. Based on the patient's travel history and symptoms, healthcare professionals suspected this new coronavirus. A clinical specimen was collected and sent to CDC overnight, where laboratory testing yesterday confirmed the diagnosis via CDC's Real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) test. U.S. Preparation CDC has been proactively preparing for the introduction of 2019-nCoV in the United States for weeks, including: First alerting clinicians on January 8, 2020, to be on the look-out for patients with respiratory symptoms and a history of travel to Wuhan, China. Developing guidance for clinicians for testing and management of 2019-nCoV, as well as guidance for home care of patients with 2019-nCoV. Developing a diagnostic test to detect this virus in clinical specimens, accelerating the time it takes to detect infection. Currently, testing for this virus must take place at CDC, but in the coming days and weeks, CDC will share these tests with domestic and international partners On January 17, 2020, CDC began implementing public health entry screening at San Francisco (SFO), New York (JFK), and Los Angeles (LAX) airports. This week CDC will add entry health screening at two more airports -- Atlanta (ATL) and Chicago (ORD). CDC has activated its Emergency Operations Center to better provide ongoing support to the 2019-nCoV response. CDC is working closely with the state of Washington and local partners. A CDC team has been deployed to support the ongoing investigation in the state of Washington, including potentially tracing close contacts to determine if anyone else has become ill.  viruses, some causing respiratory illness in people and others circulating among animals including camels, cats and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can evolve and people, such as has been seen with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and . When person-to-person spread has occurred with SARS and MERS, it is thought to happen via respiratory droplets with close contacts, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread. The situation with regard to 2019-nCoV is still unclear. While severe illness, including illness resulting in several deaths, has been reported in China, other patients have had milder illness and been discharged. Symptoms Symptoms associated with this virus have included fever, cough and trouble breathing. The confirmation that some limited person-to-person spread with this virus is occurring in Asia raises the level of concern about this virus, but CDC continues to believe the risk of 2019-nCoV to the American public at large remains low at this time. This is a rapidly evolving situation. CDC will continue to update the public as circumstances warrant. Update Second Travel-related Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Detected in United States. Friday, January 24, 2020 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today confirmed the second infection with in the United States has been detected in Illinois. The patient recently returned from Wuhan, China, where an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by this novel coronavirus has been ongoing since December 2019. The patient returned to the U.S. from Wuhan on January 13, 2020, and called a health care provider after experiencing symptoms a few days later. The patient was admitted to a hospital, where infection control measures were taken to reduce the risk of transmission to other individuals. The patient remains hospitalized in an isolation room in stable condition and is doing well. Based on the patient's travel history and symptoms, health care professionals suspected 2019-nCoV. A clinical specimen was collected and sent to CDC, where laboratory testing confirmed the infection. The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) are investigating locations where this patient went after returning to Illinois and are identifying any close contacts who were possibly exposed. The patient has limited close contacts, all of whom are currently well and who will be monitored for symptoms. Since returning from China, the patient has had very limited movement outside the home. CDC is taking aggressive public health measures to help protect the health of Americans. While CDC considers this a serious public health threat, based on current information, the immediate health risk from 2019-nCoV to the general American public is considered low at this time. CDC is working closely with the Illinois Department of Public Health, the Chicago Department of Public Health, and other local partners. A CDC team has been deployed to support the ongoing investigation. However, CDC has been proactively preparing for the introduction of 2019-nCoV in the U.S. for weeks, including: First alerting clinicians on January 8 to be on the look-out for patients with respiratory symptoms and a history of travel to Wuhan, China. Developing guidance for clinicians for testing and management of 2019-nCoV, as well as guidance for home care of patients with 2019-nCoV. Has developed a diagnostic test to detect this virus in clinical specimens. Currently, testing must take place at CDC, but CDC is preparing to share these test kits with domestic and international partners. Implementing public health entry screening at Atlanta (ATL), Chicago (ORD), Los Angeles (LAX), New York (JFK), and San Francisco (SFO) airports. CDC is currently evaluating the extent and duration of this enhanced screening. CDC has activated its Emergency Operations Center to better provide ongoing support.  viruses, some causing respiratory illness in people and others circulating among animals including camels, cats evolve and people, such as has been seen with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and . Investigations are ongoing to learn more, but person-to-person spread of 2019-nCoV is occurring. More U.S. Coronavirus Cases to Come... It is likely there will be more cases reported in the U.S. in the coming days and weeks. CDC will continue to update the public as circumstances warrant. While the immediate risk of this new virus to the American public is believed to be low at this time, there are simple daily precautions that everyone should always take. It is currently flu and respiratory disease season, and CDC recommends getting vaccinated, taking everyday preventive actions to stop the spread of germs, and taking flu antivirals if prescribed. Right now, CDC recommends travelers avoid all nonessential travel to Wuhan, China.",1
THE DEADLY CORONA VIRUS NOW ENGULFING THE PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA.,"From a colleague of mine who works in China. Dr. Steven Clark Bradley PhD Maybe this link to his videos  PRAY FOR CHINA AND THOSE INFECTED AND DYING FROM THE DEADLY CORONA VIRUS NOW ENGULFING THE PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA... I received the following videos concerning the Corona Virus and its terrible spread across the nation of China and now, even across the world. These videos will terrify you and let you know more about what is tearing China apart, at the moment. Many of my fellow teachers, whom I know so well. and with whom I work, are now in China and rarely try to leave their homes, for fear of contracting the deadly illness. The disease was initially transmitted from bats and then infected livestock. The disease was initially transmitted to humans via tainted meat, from a Wuhan fish market. According to these videos, from within China, the small number stated, as around 1500 being infected, is untrue. The actual number of those infected, with the Corona Virus, is around 100,000. Now, the entire province of Hubei, where the City of Wuhan is located, which is the point of the Corona Virus' origin, is totally closed down. There are now no flights or train service in or out of any city in Hubei Province. Bus service has now been suspended to any city, in the Shandong Province, which is the province where Qingdao, my city of residence, is located. It’s hard to tell, at this point, how bad it’s going to get because there is a long 14-day incubation period, prior to symptoms emerging. Thankfully, I am now out of China and in the Philippines. For those who are now out of China, you must decide when you feel you want to return to China, if at all. For me, I will not return to my job in China, until I know that the Corona Virus is under control, and I will not rely on any reports of all clear from the Chinese Government either. I will only return with a worldwide declaration of all clear from the World Health Organization. Pray for my friends and colleagues, who are literally under house detention, for all practical purposes. All of our lives have been turned upside-down. God is still on His throne and He still answers prayer and I know He will have mercy on the Chinese people. - Dr. Steven Clark Bradley PhD",1
FAAN advises as Nigeria braces for corona-virus,"International airports yesterday went on red alert as they intensified the screening of inbound passengers, following an outbreak of the deadly coronavirus in China. The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) advised passengers and other airport users to comply with all quarantine procedures at airports nationwide to prevent the importation of the virus. Airports worldwide also increased health screenings and the implementation of new quarantine procedures as officials hurried to slow the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, a new SARS-like illness that first appeared in Hubei province, China. The General Manager (Corporate Affairs) at FAAN, Henrietta Yakubu, said all the equipment and personnel used in combating the deadly Ebola virus in 2014 were still much in place at the airports and were being deployed accordingly. She said FAAN had always had thermal scanners at its airports to monitor the temperature of passengers and capture their pictures. “When passengers walk pass the scanner, it registers their temperature. And if it’s too high, they have pulled aside for observation. FAAN, in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Health, has confirmed the adequacy of the facilities at the nation’s airports, to prevent the importation of the virus through the airports. Passengers are therefore advised to submit themselves for routine quarantine checks whenever they are asked to,” Yakubu said. With the coronavirus (nCoV) reportedly infecting over ‘10,000’ persons and killing nine, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) disclosed that it had set up a multi-sectoral technical group to handle the threat. It advised Nigerians to remain calm, while travelers from Nigeria to Wuhan, China, have been asked to avoid contact with sick people, animals (alive or dead), and animal markets. Coronaviruses are zoonotic, which implies that they are normally transmitted between animals and people. But a novel coronavirus is a new strain of the virus that has not been previously identified in humans. Some coronaviruses can be transmitted from person to person, usually after close contact with an infected patient, in a household or health care setting. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans, until now. To reduce the risk of spreading the virus, NCDC advised members of the public to adhere to the following measures: wash your hands regularly with soap under running water; cover your mouth and nose properly with handkerchief or tissue paper when sneezing and/or coughing; you may also cough into your elbow if a handkerchief is not available; avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing; avoid self-medication, and report to the nearest health facility when you experience any of the above-mentioned symptoms.",1
"CORONA VIRUS DEATH TOLL RISES TO 80: A further 2,700 now infected","The death toll from the coronavirus has risen to 80, China’s National Health Commission has said, in the UK More than 50 people were tested but all received negative results. There were 769 reported new cases confirmed on Sunday, bringing the total number of infected to 2,744, a further five news cases being examined in Hong Kong and two in Macau.  The rapid worldwide spread continues with other cases found in Thailand, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, the US, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Nepal, France, Canada and Australia. England’s chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said there was a “fair chance” cases would emerge in Britain. The virus so far has evaded attempts at a cure and is rapidly mutating Chinese President Xi Jinping called the outbreak a grave situation and said the government was stepping up efforts to restrict travel and public gatherings while rushing medical staff and supplies to the city at the centre of the crisis, Wuhan, which remains on lockdown. China’s health minister Ma Xiaowei said travel restrictions and other strict measures should bring results “at the lowest cost and fastest speed”. The US Consulate in Wuhan plans to evacuate its personnel and some other Americans aboard a charter flight, while the UK, France and Japan are weighing up similar decisions. Where it all started, a local seafood and animal market in Wuhan. The epidemic has revived memories of the SARS outbreak that originated in China and killed nearly 800 as it spread around the world in 2002 and 2003. Its spread has come amid China’s busiest travel period of the year when millions crisscross the country or head abroad for the Lunar New Year holiday. China will extend the Lunar New Year holiday to Feb 2, the State Council said Monday (Jan 27), to try and reduce the spread of a virus. Chinese travel agencies have been told to halt all group tours, and concern is growing over the potential impact of millions of people travelling back to the cities after the Lunar New Year holiday ends on Thursday. The health commission said anyone travelling from Wuhan is now required to register with community health stations and quarantine themselves at home for 14 days – the virus’ maximum incubation period. Too little too late?-passengers arriving at an airport in China being monitored with thermal imaging equipment for signs of an infection Xinhua said medical supplies are being rushed to the city, including 14,000 protective suits, 110,000 pairs of gloves and masks and goggles. The commission said it is bringing in medical teams to help handle the outbreak and the Chinese military dispatched 450 medical staff, some with experience in past outbreaks, including SARS and Ebola, Xinhua reported.",1
China Builds Emergency Hospital For Corona Virus In 8 Days,"As the death toll of the deadly coronavirus continues to rise, China has built a 1,000-bed hospital completed in just 8 days to help tackle the outbreak. Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan, where the virus originated, is one of two dedicated facilities being constructed with 361 deaths now confirmed since the outbreak started in December. Reports have it that the hospital will begin to admit patients later today. The hospital, Huoshenshan, or “fire-god mountain”, is designed to have 1,000 beds for patients with confirmed infections to ease a shortage of beds elsewhere in the city as the virus spreads. The epidemic has infected more than 17,000 in China and at least 171 overseas. There are more than 11,000 cases in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, state television said today. Construction of Huoshenshan was copied from a hospital built in Beijing in 2003 that was dedicated to the fight against SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. More than 7,500 workers took part in the fast-build project, which commenced on January 25 and finished this weekend. China is also building a second hospital in Wuhan dedicated to the treatment of coronavirus patients, with 1,600 beds. Leishenshan, or “thunder-god mountain”, is scheduled to be completed on February 5. There are 17,205 confirmed cases of coronavirus, as of Sunday, the same day the first confirmed fatality outside China was announced. A 44-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan died in the Philippines, but appears to have become infected before arriving.",1
Child who visited China tested for Corona virus,"An 11-year-old boy currently residing in the hostel of a local school and originally a resident of New Rohtak Road, Karol Bagh, Delhi, had a runny nose and cough since yesterday. He came to AIIMS Rishikesh, today, for investigation. There was no fever and no chest pain or difficulty in breathing, sore throat or hoarseness of voice. Bowel and bladder conditions were also normal. He had visited Dongzhou Garden in Zhejiang Province of China and lived there from 19 December, 2019, to 13 January, 2020, with his father, who works there. There were no signs of illness during his stay there in any of his acquaintances. They maintained minimal contact and have no history of contact with any sick person. He later visited Phuket, Thailand, from 13 to 19 January, and returned to Delhi on 24 January. AIIMS has sent him home after initial treatment and sent samples to test for Corona virus.",1
Terra Drone’s group company helps fighting Corona virus with drones,"The Market Terra Drone’s group company helps fighting Corona virus with drones Terra Drone’s group company helps fighting Corona virus with drones By - 8 February 2020 Zhejiang – a medical delivery drone flying from the people’s Hospital of Xinchang County to the disease control center of Xinchang County successfully completed the whole process of air transportation, marking the launch of the first “urban air transportation channel” to help to fight the corona virus (2019-nCoV) which is in a worrying outbreak in China. Xinchang County is located in Zhejiang province, and Zhejiang province is one of the most severe virus hit provinces with already 1006 patients confirmed 2019-nCoV diagnose as of Feb. 6th. At present, it is in a tense period of national epidemic prevention and control. In order to respond to the needs of epidemic prevention and control, Antwork actively contacts with local hospitals, supports epidemic prevention with practical actions, fully cooperates with local governments and medical-related units, and escorts the timely and rapid delivery of medical samples and protection materials through the deployment of it’s drone transportation network. During the epidemic prevention and control period, Antwork took the initiative to take drone RA3 and tr7s as well as unmanned station RH1 as the technical solution, to do the transportation of medical samples and quarantine materials between Xinchang County People’s Hospital, Xinchang County disease control center and Dashiju branch of Xinchang County People’s hospital. In this operation, the air delivery system provided by Antwork is adopted. Its automatic and unmanned operation mode can significantly reduce the contact opportunities between samples and personnel in the transportation process, and improve the delivery speed. At the same time, the Antwork branch company (Aerodeli), which undertakes this operation task, has obtained the world’s first urban drone delivery “license” issued by Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) last October. The sample delivery work will be carried out in strict accordance with the certified operation procedures, which can ensure the safety of medical samples in the transportation process. Take off and landing point of disease control center of Xinchang County In the actual transportation process, the flight efficiency of drone has increased by more than 50% compared with the ordinary road transportation, which provides an efficient means of transportation for the epidemic prevention and control. At the same time, with more and more medical staff and ambulance being transferred to the front line, in the case of extreme personnel shortage, the use of drone transportation can also save human and material resources to the greatest extent. In addition, using drone to transport materials can effectively avoid secondary pollution of medical materials. As soon as the news of Wuhan blocking came out on January 23, Antwork immediately contacted the health and disease control departments of various regions, and took the initiative to petition for the technical support of drone air transportation for the front-line medical institutions fighting against the epidemic. After the project of Xinchang people’s hospital is put into operation, Antwork will also actively assist more medical institutions around the nation to deploy air transport services and contribute a technical force to the anti-epidemic!",1
6000 passengers stranded in Italian cruise ship over corona fears,"A giant cruise ship with more than 6000 passengers is docked for the second day as two of its passengers showed symptoms of new corona virus. All the 6000 passengers together with its crew are trapped in the cruise ship for the seconf consecutive day in the Italian port of CivitaVecchia.A couple from Hong Kong complained of fever and respiratory problems and asked for medical help while the ship was approaching the port.As they were showing signs of new Corona virus port authorities were informed who quickly blocked the ship from entering the port.The couple, who are from Macau, are believed to have boarded at Savona on January 25, having flown from Hong Kong to Milan’s international airport the same day. Blood samples of all on board are collected and they will be permitted to leave the ship only after the results arrive.",1
The next pandemic may be here - here's what you need to know about 2019-nCoV,"A new, potential pandemic is developing in Asia, and has already spread to the United States and parts of Asia. Chinese officials recently quarantined a city of nearly 12 million souls to prevent the disease from spreading from its point of origin. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is monitoring the situation and issuing updates as they come available. According to the CDC, the disease in question is ""2019-nCoV"" a ""novel coronavirus."" The virus was first detected in the city of Wuhan in central China. The disease has spread rapidly with Chinese experts confirming that it spreads from person-to-person. The Chinese have been applauded for reacting to the outbreak with impressive speed, sequencing the genome of the virus in late 2019. Coronaviruses are a large family of common viruses, some of which can mutate and become dangerous. They are often found in animals, and some strains can jump from animals to humans. Officials suspect the outbreak of the disease occurred in a large live-animal meat market where animals are sold alive or slaughtered for human consumption. However, since the initial detection of the virus, new cases have appeared which have no link to the suspected marketplace. This strongly suggests that human-to-human transmission is occurring. Chinese officials announced on Jan 22 they were quarantining the city of Wuhan. The quarantine is intended to slow or prevent further spread of the disease. Already, at least one case has been detected in the United States. About 470 cases have been confirmed, nearly all cases in China. Individual cases have been reported in Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, and the United States. There are unconfirmed reports of a case in Mexico. At least 17 deaths have been attributed to the disease. However, experts warn the official statistics often lag behind the actual numbers. Many cases are probably still unreported, and some deaths may have occurred and are being attributed or unreported. The number of infected persons could be in the thousands. British professor Neil Ferguson was quoted in The Sun, a British Tabloid, that the number of deaths appears to be ""roughly the same as for the Spanish flu epidemic."" That disease killed 50 million people around the world in just one year. By comparison, four years of warfare (World War I) produced only 35 million casualties. It is certain that many more deaths are to come and the only question is if officials can halt the spread of the disease before it goes global. Screening centers have been established at airports around the world. Travel to and from China, and possibly much of Asia may be stopped if the disease keeps spreading. At present, it appears that older people and people with underlying health conditions are at greatest risk. It is unclear how easily the virus spreads from person-to-person. The virus causes pneumonia in some patients, which is sometimes fatal. Officials are still learning about the disease. The best advice is to avoid travel, especially to the central region of China where the outbreak is ongoing. If the disease spreads, all people will need to take precautions. Minimizing unnecessary travel and human contact is the first step. Those who are sick should remain home, unless their condition deteriorates and requires medical attention. Face masks and handwashing are critical to preventing infection. Hand sanitizer also helps. At this time, there is no need for general alarm, but all people should pay attention to updates from official sources in the weeks and months ahead. If the disease does spread, public notices and directives will be issued. It is important that all people follow such recommendations. Even the worst pandemic diseases eventually ""burn"" themselves out. But periodically, diseases emerge that have the right combination of contagiousness and virulence. When that happens, as has happened many times in history, millions of people may die. Such diseases tend to emerge in densely populated areas, especially where there is close contact between humans and animals. This is why many new viruses seem to emerge from China. It is a product of population density. Pandemic diseases have changed the course of history. Notable examples include the Black Death between 1347-1354, and the Colombian Exchange between the Americas and the rest of the world. The Colombian Exchange resulted in the deaths of about 100 million native people as a result of the cocktail of diseases which European settlers carried with them.",1
"Corona devastates Silk industry , Banarasi silk industry duck-walks now","The coronavirus epidemic which started from Wuhan in the industrial province of Hubei had spread far and wide outside China. The disease had started its death toll outside China and with a startling rate of propagation WHO issued a global health emergency last week to curb the spread. This emergency gives nations to override trade agreements and impose export restrictions to China. Chinese President Xi had yesterday urged the US to approach Corona with a calm head and alleged US hands behind some trade restrictions which could impede Chinese economic growth. India had just followed the trend of many nations imposing a ban on its citizens for traveling to China and had even expanded the ban to tourists who had recently visited China. The import of Chinese goods is also a part of these restrictions. An import order of 1500 tons of Silk from China is now scrapped due to the import restrictions. The silk was for the buzzing Banaras, City famous for its silk sarees and garments.“The shipment of raw material was supposed to start by February 4 but it hasn’t due to the coronavirus. This is going to affect the life of skilled workers and overall business,” said Nishat Malhotra owner of a silk weaving factory. The silk for the industry comes from China, and the industry is now duck-walking with material scarcity.“The dupion silk, brought to India from China’s Sichuan province, is the raw yarn that weavers in Banaras use to make the silk sari. Though it’s produced in Bengaluru as well, there is a significant difference in price and quality,” “Many artisans are jobless now and the future is blank as it is not sure when the restrictions will be lifted, as the epidemic still continues strong in China”, said Malhotra. The coronavirus will impact global business and make the economy more sluggish with long-term implications.",1
"Applied DNA Sciences Subsidiary, LineaRx, and Takis Biotech Collaborate for Development of a Linear DNA Vaccine Candidate Against Wuhan Coronavirus 2019-nCoV Seite","Applied DNA Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ: APDN) (“Applied DNA” or the “Company”) a leader in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based DNA manufacturing for product authenticity, traceability solutions, nucleic acid-based biotherapeutic development, and liquid biopsies for cancer diagnostics, announced today and in a late-day Investor Call yesterday, that it has expanded its existing Joint Development Agreement (JDA) with Takis Biotech to include the preclinical development of a linear DNA vaccine against 2019-nCoV, the new coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, infecting more than 28,000 and killing hundreds in just weeks. The advantages posed by PCR-produced linear DNA for this challenge include the speed of production, the absence of antibiotics and their resistance genes, the purity of the DNA, the simplicity of design, the powerful immunogenicity proved in a prior linear DNA vaccine, the absence of any bacterial contaminants and the fact that the vaccine gene is effective without insertion into the patient’s genome. The virus expanded its hosts to humans and has been declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) and by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). LineaRx, Inc. (“LineaRx”) is the majority-owned subsidiary of Applied DNA focused on the therapeutic and diagnostic applications of the Company’s large-scale PCR platform that is protected by multiple issued and pending patents. “We have a patented and proprietary platform for the production of linear DNA that empowers rapid development and large-scale production that we believe will yield a safe and effective vaccine with fewer risks than other DNA production platforms,” said Dr. James Hayward, president and CEO of both Applied DNA and LineaRx. “As is typical for RNA viruses, coronaviruses mutate at rapid rates that require constant surveillance 1 . We believe that one of the many benefits of PCR-produced linear DNA is the rapidity at which a putative vaccine can be revised to accommodate mutational drift.” Dr. Luigi Aurisicchio, CEO/CSO of Takis, stated, “Our collaboration under the JDA on genetic technologies has already shown the ability to induce powerful immune responses in animal models using linear DNA. To induce antibodies that can neutralize 2019-nCoV, it is essential to use reliable, effective technologies, that can be quickly adapted in the face of shifting pathogens.",1
This Is What Happened After One Chinese Company Rushed To Reopen After The Corona-Chaos,"Earlier today, Rabobank’s Michael Every laid out succinctly the dilemma facing Beijing, when he said that “China appears to have perhaps decided that the economic damage being wrought by a demand collapse and supply-chain shutdown is just too much to bear.” As reported overnight, Xi Jinping stated that China will meet its economic goals AND win the battle vs. the virus, and Beijing is urging firms to increase output even as the capital itself is largely locked down – and other cities are physically locking people into their homes. That’s as even the US admits that the Phase One trade deal will be slow off the market due to the virus impact. Of course, China is no stranger to Double Think: as Every put it, “a freely-floating, controlled currency; market-determined, state-directed interest rates; and free-trade mercantilism. Yet increase economic activity from here and the virus will spread, both internally and globally. Concentrate on just the virus, and the local and global economic impact will be enormous.” That, in a nutshell, was how Rabobank saw China’s “dialectic that has no comfortable Fichtean synthesis to the thesis and antithesis” and concluded that “things are going to get nasty for economies and markets – especially with official WHO word that a vaccine is 18-months away.” Today, two days after China officially returned to work, we got the first confirmation of just how catastrophic Beijing’s order to local enterprises and businesses to rush back reboot the economy could be, when Jennifer Zeng reported that a company in Suzhou reopened, and immediately at least one CoVid2019 case found. As a result, the company’s 200+ employees couldn’t go home and were immediately placed under quarantine . At least the workers managed to “organize” quilts for themselves. Company in #Suzhou reopened. One #CoVid2019 case found. Over 200 employed couldn't go home and immediately under quarantine. They managed to organize quilts for themselves. This is just the first such case. Expect many more – especially across Hubei and its neighboring provinces – as latent cases of Coronavirus which were never caught and cured spark new infections and mini epidemics, all of which dutifully captured on a smartphone clip for everyone in China to watch and freak out even more. Which reminds us of another comment from Rabobank, which last week explained why the dilemma facing China is “truly awful”: The quandary for China between releasing the quarantine straitjacket in days to stop its economy from getting truly sick, and allowing a virus like this to spread further as people start to mingle again is truly awful. There are no good options. For a world with a serious lack of final end-demand, and which has been relying on China, along with increasingly “Chinese” central banks, this is going to be a nasty shock either way that Mr Market is treating like he is Mr Magoo. And since Beijing has no way out, especially since the epidemic is still raging despite Beijing’s “doctored”, no pun intended, infection and death numbers, expect China to unleash the most draconian censorship crackdown on any reports Covid-2019 has not only not been purged but is making unwelcome appearances across China’s enterprises, which will be quietly put under blanket quarantine even as Beijing pretends that all is well and its economy is once again humming on all cylinders until eventually the epidemic reaches a critical mass and China has no choice but to once again admit the full extent of the social and economic fallout. And just like in the case of SARS, don’t expect such “honesty” to emerge for at least several weeks if not months.",1
Cebu City safe from wild animals’ meat that may be source of 2019-nCoV,"The Cebu City Department of Veterinary Medicine and Fisheries (DVMF) said there are no wild animals’ meat in Cebu City that may carry the feared 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Wuhan City, China. Doctor Jennifer Laurente, the head of the DVMF, told CDN Digital in a phone interview, that the novel coronavirus comes from wild animals’ meat sold in a Wuhan public market, specifically those from bats used for bat soup. Others that can be sources or carriers are meat from bamboo rats, ostriches, baby crocodiles, and hedghogs. Meat from these animals are not commonly sold in the public markets in Cebu City, but some of these may be sold in the markets in the provinces, although less likely. “The public does not need to worry because wild animals’ meat are not sold in Cebu City. Even if there is, the meat inspectors are capable of apprehending such,” said Laurente. Laurente also said they are now coordinating with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) for the list of other wild animals that may be carriers of the 2019-nCoV for profiling. She said the city must still be cautious because any entry of these kinds of meat can jeopardize the safety of the public. With this, intensified inspections of meat and documents are being implemented in all public markets in Cebu City. Even smaller markets in the mountain barangays are also being monitored. Laurente urged the public not to panic regarding the 2019-nCoV but should remain vigilant by boosting ones immune system and ensuring the meat they eat are safe.",1
"Corona Virus Hotline 166, Death Penalty, Vat Phou Festival, and Moving Houses","From court sentences and truck rollovers to Corona Virus emergency hotlines and mobile houses, this list gives readers a taste of the kinds of topics that are extensively shared in the Lao social media. Truck Overturn A Vietnamese truck rolled over on to its side on the road to Xepon (Savannakhet). The truck was carrying processed wood. According to eyewitnesses, the accident caused 5 hours of traffic. Fortunately, no casualties were reported. The cause of the truck overturn is still being investigated. Moving Houses These villagers in Houaphanh took the meaning of “helping each other move houses” to a whole new level. Men, women, and children of all ages came together to help pull the house on stilts to a location a few meters away. For many social media users in the urban areas, this was truly a sight to behold. But for many others on city outskirts and rural areas, this was a commonplace event. Some even offered this as a business service (for smaller, more mobile homes). The Woman In the Red Dress Last week was all about the Lunar New Year. Locals with both Chinese and Vietnamese ancestry gathered together to celebrate this momentous occasion. A beautiful woman dressed in a Chinese traditional red dress was featured on Tholakhong, and the social media crowd almost overwhelmingly concluded that this was not a Lao woman, and that she had to be either Vietnamese or Chinese, or mixed. Eating & Studying A purposely comical video of a famous teen idol sneaking in bites of cup noodles amidst a lecture in university seemed to resonate with many former and current students. Good Samaritan An upstanding citizen has been praised on social media for his honest ethic. Phonexay Thongpaseuth went to a convenience store to purchase top-up phone cards and requested five 10,000 kip cards and one 50,000 kip card, totaling 100,000 kip. When he got home, he realized that the staff member who had sold him the cards had mistakenly given him five 100,000 kip cards worth quite a lot. The good samaritan promised to return the cards so that the staff member would not be penalized for his error. No More Entry Fees For the Vat Phou Festival A notice issued by the Champasak Provincial Administrative Office stated that there will be no more entry fees at the annual Vat Phou Festival to be held this 6-8 February. For more pictures on the activities of festivals in the past, click here . Beloved Thai News Anchor Sentenced to Prison The Thai Supreme Court sentenced Sorrayuth Suthassanachinda, one of Thailand’s most well-known and highest-paid news anchormen, to 8 years in jail for embezzlement. The Thai courts found the 53-year-old veteran journalist guilty of embezzling over 138 million baht that rightfully belonged to the Mass Communication Organization of Thailand (MCOT). The embezzlement took place while Sorrayuth was the host of a news program on Channel 9, a media outlet of MCOT, between 2005 and 2006. Sorrayuth has since paid back all the money to MCOT. Sorrayuth shot to fame with his uniquely aggressive style of news presentation and won the attention of Lao viewers, many of whom follow news from Thai television media. “ Leuang Lao Chao Nee ,” the Channel 3 morning news program co-hosted by Sorrayuth, was followed by a huge percentage of Lao audiences. Thai Robinson Gold Shop Killer Arrested Lao social media users praised foreign police as they arrested the man responsible for the shopping mall looting and shooting of 3 people, including a 2-year-old boy in Lopburi, Thailand. The most disturbing part of the case was that the suspect was a 39-year-old civil servant and director of a primary school who confessed that he robbed and killed for fun. Two Men Shot to Death Near 450-Year Road Hatsayfong police are on the lookout for the killer of two men, who were shot to death while in their car in vacant land in the 450-Year Road.

Corona virus unlikely to affect Taiwan’s overall economy in the short term,"The corona virus epidemic affecting China and having been declared a global public health emergency should not drastically affect Taiwan’s overall economy in the short term but has the probability to affect the tourism and aviation sectors, as anticipated by economists. The corona virus has claimed the lives of at least 361 people in China, infecting more than 17,000 people, and there are no signs that it will soon be brought under control, casting a shadow over China’s economic prospects, global growth, and the world’s financial markets. Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) President Chang Chien-yi said that the epidemic’s impact on Taiwan’s economy is expected to be short-lived. The TIER raised its forecast for Taiwan’s 2020 economic growth to 2.67 percent in January, 0.22 percentage points higher than its previous estimate in November 2019. Chang, however, said that the epidemic could shake investment confidence having a major impact on specific sectors, including the tourism, travel, and transportation sectors. However, he believes that targeted measures would be introduced to help those industries. Chang said that the epidemic will affect the technology and manufacturing sectors slightly because domestic factories are still running normally. Chou Yeu-tien, a research fellow with the Institute of Economics at Academia Sinica, agreed that the epidemic would not have a major impact on the domestic economy, but Taiwan still needs to keep a close watch on the spread corona virus in China.

Bizmen fear losses after corona virus outbreak in China,"Bizmen fear losses after corona virus outbreak in China 13 IST Ludhiana: The outbreak of corona virus in China has dented business prospects of some local businessmen, who are frequent travellers to that country for importing goods from that country. A variety of goods, including electronics, sanitary products, rubber products, etc. are imported in huge numbers from China here every month. Spreading of this epidemic has not only put brakes on the travel plans of businessmen to China but at the same time they are anticipating high losses if the situation is not controlled immediately. Giving more information, Ankit Sahni, a city-based importer, said, “After the reports of spread of corona virus in China, I have cancelled my visit to Guangzhou. Due to the last minute cancellation, I will have to bear losses on account of cancellation of my air ticket and forfeiture of my hotel booking. Besides this, it is going to cost me dear as I was going to China to finalise a deal of import of tyres and now, I will have to wait until the situation improves there.” According to Sanjeev Sharma, an auto parts importer, “Wuhan, which is said to be the epicentre of the corona virus, is one of the largest industrial hubs of China and there is a huge number of automotive component factories located there. The outbreak of the deadly virus has already started casting its shadow on business as since Monday, we are unable to contact one of our prominent suppliers, who is based in Wuhan. If the epidemic is not controlled, along with the mounting loss of lives, it will also lead to huge losses for both businessmen in China and those who trade with them.” According to Ravi Kant Chabra, another importer based in Ludhiana, “This corona virus problem is evident from the fact that how hard it is now to do international business. Spreading of such epidemics not only makes travelling and doing business in such countries impossible but at the same time it also has its side effects like temporary closure of trade or stringent checking of consignments, which in turn causes delays in shipments, eventually resulting in heavy losses for us.”",1

"Two patients under investigation in CL, negative for 2019 nCoV ARD","Two patients under investigation (PUIs) in Central Luzon tested negative for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Disease (nCov ARD). This was confirmed by Jose B. Lingad Memorial General Hospital (JBLMGH) Chief Monserrat Chichioco during a press conference. “Of the 10 PUIs in Central Luzon as of February 2, 2020, six were admitted in our facility. Two are from Pampanga, two are from Bulacan, one is a Taiwanese, and the other one is a British national,” Chichioco said. In addition, she said that they are still awaiting the results of the remaining four PUIs admitted in the hospital from the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine. “Despite having six cases in our facility, we want to assure the public that all these PUIs are in stable condition, except for one who has a co-morbid disease,” the hospital chief said. Chichioco also assured the public that there is no cause for alarm because the hospital has dedicated two isolation buildings—one for PUIs, and one for those who will be tested positive for the nCoV ARD in case. Aside from that, the hospital, she said, has six critical isolation room, as well as case management protocols in place. “We have trained personnel who are capable of managing the cases. We are also equipped with the personal protective equipment. We also have our protocol that all patients who are admitted at the emergency room, and who have coughs and colds, will be given surgical masks, to avoid transmission of any virus,” she said. Meanwhile, Department of Health (DOH) Central Luzon Center for Health Development (CL-CHD) Communicable Diseases Cluster Head Maria Eloisa Vidar reiterated that DOH only recommends the use of surgical masks among those who are sick, who are taking care of the sick, are recovering from illness, and those who cannot avoid crowded places. “Well and healthy individuals are not advised to wear masks. In case an individual opt to wear one, surgical mask is enough and is more appropriate than the N95 mask,” she said. For her part, DOH CL-CHD Local Health Support Division Chief Lailani Mangulabnan said that the best way to avoid contracting the disease is to boost one’s immune system through halthy lifestyle and stress management. “The public should always practice proper hand hygiene and coughing etiquette, including the no spitting anywhere. Cooking food thoroughly, avoiding crowded places, and avoiding people with signs and symptoms of nCoV ARD should always be observed,” Mangulabnan said. She also appealed to the public to stay calm, be responsible, refrain from sharing unverified information on the disease to avoid scare or panic. As of February 3, 15 PUIs were reported by the DOH in Central Luzon. Share this:",1

Copper prices maintain downward trend amid fast-spreading Corona outbreak,"Copper prices on the international market have continued falling to below the US $6,000 per metric tonne threshold to US $5,779 per tonne, its lowest since October, last year. While copper prices started the New Year on a bullish note, trading at over US $6,300 per tonne amidst optimism of the US-China trade deal breakthrough, prices of the red metal had significantly dropped in the one-week period since news of the deadly Corona virus. According to the London Metal Exchange (LME), copper prices dropped to around US $6,158.58 by January 21, before plunging further to US $5,779 as at January 28, representing a loss of US $379.58 or around 6.17 per cent within a one-week period. The continued price fall had continued to be influenced by investors’ fears that the new strain of the virus could negatively affect China’s economic growth and dampen demand for the commodity, according to Reuters. “Copper fell for a ninth consecutive session on Monday (January 27), the longest losing streak in six years, as investors worried that a spreading Corona virus outbreak in China would hit demand in the world’s biggest metals consumer. Copper tumbled to its weakest in three months, with other industrial metals also sliding as investors took flight,” reports Reuters. “The death toll from the virus rose to 81 on Monday as the government extended the Lunar New Year holiday and more big businesses shut down or told staff to work from home in an effort to curb the outbreak. Copper, regarded as a bellwether of the global economy, has given up all of its gains since early December when a rally pushed prices up nearly 10 per cent to eight-month highs as investors welcomed the first phase of a US-China trade deal and hoped for a rebound in economic growth.” Chinese demand accounts for about 50 per cent of the majority of base metals, according to investment bank BMO Capital. The virus, also known as 2019-nCoV, is understood to be a new strain of Corona virus that had not previously been identified in humans. It is believed to have originated from infected animals at a seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan, a central Chinese city of 11 million people, late last year. There are currently 4,515 confirmed cases in China compared to just 218 confirmed cases of the virus a fortnight ago, with over 100 deaths recorded so far.",1

WHO to accelerate WAR against Corona,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) will convene a global research and innovation forum next week to mobilise international efforts to combat the deadly novel coronavirus outbreak, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva. The forum, to be held here from February 11-12, has been organised in collaboration with the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness, reports Xinhua news agency. It will bring together key players in critical public health research and the development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, among other innovations. Participants, including leading scientists, public health agencies, ministries of health and research funders, will discuss such areas of research as identifying the source of the virus as well as sharing of biological samples and genetic sequences. Experts will build on existing SARS and MERS coronavirus research and identify knowledge gaps and research priorities, in order to accelerate scientific information and medical products that are most needed to minimise the impact of this novel coronavirus outbreak. “Harnessing the power of science is critical for bringing this outbreak under control,” Tedros told the media on Thursday. “There are questions we need answers to, and tools we need developed as quickly as possible. WHO is playing an important coordinating role by bringing the scientific community together to identify research priorities and accelerate progress,” he said. The meeting is expected to produce a global research agenda for the novel coronavirus, setting priorities and frameworks that can guide which projects are undertaken first, which should lead to more efficient investments, high-quality research and synergies among global researchers, according to the WHO. “Understanding the disease, its reservoirs, transmission and clinical severity and then developing effective counter-measures is critical for the control of the outbreak, to reduce deaths and minimise the economic impact,” said Soumya Swaminathan, the WHO chief scientist.

PM Morrison’s say on Australia extending travel restriction re corona virus for one more week,"Home 2020 February 13 Headlines PM Morrison’s say on Australia extending travel restriction re corona virus for one more week PM Morrison’s say on Australia extending travel restriction re corona virus for one more week February 13, 2020 The National Security Committee of Cabinet has today agreed to extend the entry restrictions on foreign nationals who have recently been in mainland China for a further week from 15 February 2020 to protect Australians from the risk of coronavirus. As always, our priority is to keep Australians safe. This decision is underpinned by medical advice and recommendations from the Commonwealth’s Chief Medical Officer and chief medical officers from each state and territory, on the steps necessary to contain the spread of coronavirus. The Chief Medical Officer confirmed that our arrangements to protect Australians from coronavirus are working – there are no confirmed cases among Australian citizens and residents who have returned to Australia since the introduction of the border measures on 1 February 2020. The restrictions will be reviewed by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) in one week. We are announcing this decision now to give certainty to travellers, businesses and organisations. The continuation of the travel restrictions means that for a further week, foreign nationals – excluding permanent residents – who have been in mainland China will not be allowed to enter Australia for 14 days from the time they left. As before, Australian citizens and permanent residents will still be able to enter, as will their immediate family members (spouses, legal guardians and dependants only). We continue to require Australian citizens, permanent residents and their families who have been in mainland China from 1 February 2020, and who return Australia, to self-isolate for 14 days from the time they left mainland China. Australia is one of 58 countries that has introduced some form of travel restrictions on passengers who have been in mainland China. The AHPPC has advised that the situation with Coronavirus in mainland China has not improved in the past two weeks. There is continuing and concerning growth of cases and mortality in Hubei province and further, though slower, growth in other regions of mainland China. Today’s decision is one of a number of measures the Government has taken to protect public health and keep Australians safe at home and abroad. With help from Qantas and the cooperation of Chinese authorities, we have assisted the departure of 532 Australians from Wuhan. On the advice of the AHPPC, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will maintain its travel advice for mainland China at “Do not travel” until there is a material change in the global situation. Border measures to screen passengers on flights and vessels from mainland China and for people who have been in, or transited through, mainland China in the past 14 days will also continue. These measures are all kept under regular review. We will continue to work in close cooperation with state and territory government authorities and our international partners. The Morrison Government can reassure Australians that our nation is well-equipped and prepared for this global health challenge.",1

China's Corona Virus Outbreak: Everything We Know About The Deadly New Virus,"China's Corona Virus Outbreak: Everything We Know About The Deadly New Virus China's Corona Virus Outbreak: Everything We Know About The Deadly New Virus A man in Wuhan, China, is wearing a face mask. Getty Images A never-before-seen virus found in central China's Wuhan city claimed two lives and infected dozens of Chinese people with pneumonia. It was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31 , 2019 and has been under investigation since then. The WHO states that there are still many unknowns, but Chinese scientists have linked the disease to a family of viruses known as ""coronaviruses"", the same family as the fatal SARS and MERS -Viruses To understand how destructive the new virus called 2019-nCoV could be. Researchers are beginning to understand where it comes from, how it is transmitted, how widespread it is, and what symptoms patients are facing. The good news is that 2019-nCoV doesn't seem to be very contagious for now. However, as the number of cases in China and abroad has risen to almost 200, the authorities are taking measures to prevent the spread. Researchers believe the number of cases may be higher than current reports indicate, and three U.S. airports have started to screen incoming passengers for signs of illness, as well as high-traffic airports in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Malaysia. Here is everything we know about the mystery virus right now. What is a corona virus? Coronaviruses belong to a family of viruses known as Coronaviridae which look like spiked rings under an electron microscope. They are named because of these spines that form a halo around their viral envelope. Coronaviruses contain an RNA strand in their envelope and cannot multiply without getting into living cells and kidnapping the machinery inside. The spikes on their envelope help them bind to cells, which gives them an entry point. Once inside, they turn the cell into a virus factory and use their molecular conveyor to produce and send more viruses. The new viruses infect another cell, the cycle begins again. These virus types typically occur in animals, which range from farm animals and domestic animals to wild animals such as bats. When jumping to people, they can cause fever, respiratory problems, and inflammation in the lungs. In immunocompromised people, such as the elderly or people with HIV-AIDS, they can cause serious respiratory diseases. The causative agents of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) were extremely pathogenic coronaviruses. It was found that it can be easily transmitted from person to person. SARS infected more than 8,000 people and resulted in nearly 800 deaths, MERS nearly 2,500 with over 850 deaths. Where did the virus come from? The virus appears from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, a Chinese city with more than 11 million inhabitants, about 650 miles south of Beijing. The market sells fish and a variety of other animal meats. However, it is not yet known whether it originated from an animal such as previous coronaviruses, SARS and MERS. Markets have been involved in the development and spread of viral diseases in previous epidemics, and much of the confirmed cases have been observed. So far, I have been to the Huanan Seafood Marketplace in the past few weeks. The market seems to be an integral part of the puzzle, but researchers need to do a number of experiments and tests to confirm the virus's origin. ""Tests on animals in the Wuhan region, including samples from the markets, will allow more information,"" said Raina MacIntyre, director of the biosafety research program at the Kirby Institute at the University of New South Wales. How many cases have been reported? By January 16, 41 cases of a 59 were possible, had been confirmed in Wuhan. On January 19, another case was confirmed in Shenzhen, China, for a 66-year-old man who traveled to Wuhan in December. Two other cases were confirmed in Thailand, and one case was reported in Japan on January 19 17. The Wuhan City Health Commission issued a press release on January 18 that reported 17 new cases of the unknown virus were. A day later, the Chinese authorities confirmed 136 new cases in Wuhan, Beijing and Shenzhen, bringing the total to 198 cases. The increase in cases was due to Chinese health authorities looking for the virus in patients with pneumonia symptoms. National authorities in China continue to monitor more than 800 residents who have visited or who have had long-term contact with the Wuhan market for symptoms of the novel disease. Three deaths were recorded. The first death occurred on a 61-year-old man who had visited the Wuhan market and had chronic liver and abdominal tumors. The second death occurred in a 69-year-old man who introduced himself to the hospital with severe damage to several organs. A study published on January 17 by Imperial College London estimates that the total number of 2019 nCoV cases could be much higher than reported, with over 1,700 cases. The work led by Neil Ferguson calculated how far the virus is likely to spread based on its incubation period and the amount of travel in and out of Wuhan since it was first discovered. How does the corona virus spread? This is one of the most important questions that researchers are working feverishly to answer. It is unclear which animals act as a reservoir for the virus and what role the markets for live animals play in the spread. There are no reports of health officials and companions who have the disease, suggesting that human-to-human transmission is limited – but this is still being investigated. ""It does not appear to be very contagious between people at this stage, based on approximately 60 known symptomatic cases,"" Macintyre said in a statement on January 17. The market, which was considered the epicenter of the spread, was closed on January 1st. The World Health The organization has suggested that human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out at this time, which could be cause for concern for authorities trying to slow the disease. The fact that some cases do not appear to be related to the Huan fish market means We cannot rule out the possibility of restricted human-to-human transmission. – World Health Organization West Pacific (@WHOWPRO) January 16, 2020 What are the symptoms? The novel coronavirus causes symptoms similar to those of pr obviously identified disease-causing coronaviruses.

WHO answers questions about 2019-nCov ARD,"By Richa Noriega The World Health Organization (WHO) released on Tuesday some facts about the 2019-novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (nCoV ARD). In a Facebook post, the special agency of the United Nations concerning international public health clarified some questions regarding the deadly respiratory virus. • Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating nCoV ARD? “No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria,” WHO said, noting that nCoV is a virus, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as means of prevention or treatment. “However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV ARD, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible,” it added. • Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat nCoV ARD? “To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat nCoV ARD,” WHO said. It clarified that those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat the symptoms. Those with severe illness should be given optimized supportive care. “Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials,” it said. • Does nCoV ARD affect older people, or are younger people are also susceptible? “People of all ages can be infected by the nCoV ARD,” WHO said. Older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. WHO advised the public to protect themselves by observing good hand and respiratory hygiene. • Can pets at home spread the nCoV ARD? “At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the nCoV ARD,” WHO said.
