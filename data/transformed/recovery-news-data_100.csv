This briefing has ended. Read our global live coverage here.
Trump released national guidelines to control the virus.The Trump administration released new guidelines on Monday to slow the spread of the coronavirus, including closing schools and avoiding groups of more than 10 people, discretionary travel, bars, restaurants and food courts.
Mr. Trump, flanked by task force members including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the guidelines would apply for 15 days.
‚ÄúIt seems to me if we do a really good job, we‚Äôll not only hold the death down to a level that‚Äôs much lower than the other way had we not done a good job, but people are talking about July, August,‚Äù Mr. Trump said about the duration of the crisis.
The new measures reflected the increasing gravity of global attempts to contain the virus as governments around the world, from Canada to Hungary, moved to close their borders to foreign travelers. They left unanswered the question of precisely what individuals and local governments should do, or how business owners and workers might survive financially, at a time when vast sections of the economy were ceasing to function.
‚ÄúIf everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now,‚Äù Mr. Trump said, ‚Äúwe will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus and we‚Äôre going to have a big celebration all together.‚Äù
Hours earlier, Mr. Trump told a group of governors they should not wait for the federal government to fill the growing demand for respirators needed to help people diagnosed with coronavirus.
‚ÄúRespirators, ventilators, all of the equipment ‚Äî try getting it yourselves,‚Äù Mr. Trump told the governors during the conference call, a recording of which was shared with The New York Times.
The suggestion surprised some of the governors, who have been scrambling to contain the outbreak and looking to the federal government for help with equipment, personnel and financial aid.
At the briefing with the president, Dr. Fauci said the first phase of testing of a possible vaccine had begun on Monday. He stressed that some of the White House guidelines were inconvenient, but that they would help stop the spread of the virus and were not an overreaction.
‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre dealing with an emerging infectious diseases outbreak,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúyou are always behind where you think you are.‚Äù
Measures to slow the virus are slowing the economy, too.
It was clear on Monday that most of the American economy was grinding to a halt, and would remain that way for months, because of the coronavirus outbreak and the sweeping steps being taken to try to halt it.
On Wall Street, brokers and analysts were acting as if an economic collapse were inevitable, despite the Federal Reserve‚Äôs emergency moves on Sunday night to stoke economic growth through an aggressive bond-buying program. The S&P 500 fell nearly 12 percent on Monday and global oil prices slid below $30 a barrel, a four-year low.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre calling the recession,‚Äù said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. ‚ÄúWe have the three elements to make that call ‚Äî a profound, pervasive and persistent contraction in economic activity.‚Äù
Business groups, local and state leaders and a growing chorus of lawmakers and economists begged the federal government to spend trillions of dollars to pay workers to stay home and funnel money to companies struggling with an abrupt end to consumer activity.
The administration floated several ideas for helping industry without conveying a clear plan. After the main trade group for airlines suggested a $50 billion bailout, Mr. Trump‚Äôs chief economist, Larry Kudlow, said, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt see the airlines failing, but if they get into a cash crunch we‚Äôre going to try to help them.‚Äù
Employers and employees are torn between fears of being exposed to the virus and fears of running out of money to pay for food and electricity. And government officials are left with the unhappy task of shutting down businesses that provide wages for large swaths of their communities, while wondering what steps their neighbors are taking.
On Monday, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah called for the government to cut a $1,000 check, immediately, to every American.
‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt have reserves, they live hand-to mouth,‚Äù said Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel-winning economist. ‚ÄúPeople won‚Äôt be able to pay their rents, landlords won‚Äôt be able to pay their oil bills, the whole system could break down.‚Äù
The consequences of China‚Äôs harsh measures to halt the virus ‚Äî restricting the movement of about 700 million people at one point ‚Äî became apparent on Monday when the government released economic data showing industrial output falling to its lowest level in decades and unemployment rising at its highest rate ever in February.
The Kentucky Derby is postponed until September.For the first time since World War II, the Kentucky Derby will not take place on the first Saturday in May.
The Derby, the first jewel of horse racing‚Äôs Triple Crown, became the latest marquee sporting event forced to postpone because of the deepening coronavirus pandemic.
Churchill Downs will hold a conference call on Tuesday morning to announce a makeup date for the race, which is expected to be Sept. 5. The Courier-Journal newspaper in Louisville, Ky., where the race is held, had earlier reported the postponement.
The race, which touts itself as the ‚Äúmost exciting two minutes in sports,‚Äù regularly draws more than 150,000 spectators to the famed racetrack with its twin spires.
The coronavirus has transformed the sporting landscape. The N.B.A., the N.H.L. and Major League Baseball have all suspended play, and the N.C.A.A. canceled all of its championships.
Racetracks across the country have been shuttered to the public, but races are still being run and bets are still being welcomed. According to The Courier-Journal, the Derby and the weeks of celebration that surround it infuse the region with about $400 million yearly.
In 1945, the Kentucky Derby was held on June 9, about a month after the government lifted a ban on horse racing that it put in place because of World War II. The only other year the race did not take place on the first Saturday in May was in 1901.
Latin America begins grappling with the virus.
Stringent measures were imposed over the weekend in several Latin American nations, where the outbreak has generally arrived later than in Europe or North America.
In Venezuela, President Nicol√°s Maduro ‚Äî an authoritarian leader whose government is considered illegitimate by the United States and about 60 other nations ‚Äî seized on the upheaval caused by the pandemic to present himself as a responsible guardian of public health.
On Monday night, in an announcement made on state TV, Mr. Maduro said a nationwide quarantine would take effect Tuesday at 5 a.m. local time. The country is now at 33 cases, according to Mr. Maduro, who called the move ‚Äúa drastic and necessary measure.‚Äù
Earlier in the day, he responded to 17 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country by ordering a lockdown of the capital, Caracas, and six other states on Monday. ‚ÄúWe either go into quarantine, or the pandemic could brutally and tragically bring down our country,‚Äù he said in a terse televised speech on Sunday that was a departure from his typically rambling addresses. He called on the United States to loosen sanctions against his government.
Other Latin American countries have also responded to dozens of confirmed cases. Ecuador and Peru announced countrywide lockdowns. President Iv√°n Duque of Colombia shut the borders to nonresidents. In Costa Rica, the government decreed a state of emergency that included closing its borders.
In contrast, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil encouraged mass demonstrations by his supporters against his opponents in Congress on Sunday. Though Mr. Bolsonaro has been close to people who tested positive for the virus, he shook hands and posed for photos with supporters.
Scientists say there are likely 5 to 10 undetected cases for every confirmed one.
Scientists tracking the spread of the coronavirus reported Monday that, for every confirmed case, there are most likely another five to 10 people in the community with undetected infections. On average these people are about half as infectious as confirmed ones, but they are responsible for transmitting the virus in nearly 80 percent of new cases, according to the report, which was based on data from China.
The researchers modeled the virus‚Äôs natural spread in China before the government instituted a travel ban and an aggressive testing policy. During that time, from December 2019 through late January, about 85 percent of cases went undetected. That situation is analogous to the current state of affairs in the United States and other Western countries, where tests are not widely available, the researchers said.
‚ÄúIf we have 3,500 confirmed cases in the U.S., you might be looking at 35,000 in reality,‚Äù said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University and the senior author of the new report, which was posted by the journal Science.
The report is among the first to address two pressing questions: How many people are walking around with unrecognized infections, and how infectious are they? American policymakers have begun taking more aggressive measures to slow transmission, like canceling events and closing restaurants, but access to tests has been difficult or nonexistent in much of the country.
The E.U. plans to seal itself off from almost all international travel.
The top official of the European Union said on Monday that she was proposing a shutdown of all nonessential travel into the bloc. President Emmanuel Macron of France said national leaders would approve the plan on Tuesday.
‚ÄúWe propose to introduce a temporary restriction to non-essential travel to the European Union,‚Äù said Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, after a teleconference with G7 leaders. ‚ÄúOf course there will be exemptions for E.U. citizens coming back home, health care workers, doctors and nurses.‚Äù
The restriction would last for 30 days, and would not interfere with travel from one European Union country to another. But some of the member states have already taken steps in that direction.
Ten of the 26 countries that make up the passport-free Schengen Area have reintroduced border controls, partly or fully suspending the rules of the flagship European Union program, a spokesman for the European Commission said.
The Trump administration turns on itself.
Infighting, turf wars and a president more concerned with the stock market and media coverage than policy have defined the Trump White House. They have also defined how it has handled a pandemic.
The White House culture that President Trump has fostered and abided by for more than three years has shaped his administration‚Äôs response to a deadly pandemic that is upending his presidency and the rest of the country, with dramatic changes to how Americans live their daily lives.
It all explains how Mr. Trump could announce he was dismissing his acting chief of staff as the crisis grew more severe, creating even less clarity in an already fractured chain of command. And it was a major factor in the president‚Äôs reluctance to even acknowledge a looming crisis, for fear of rattling the financial markets that serve as his political weather vane.
Mr. Trump has refused repeated warnings to rely on experts, or to neutralize some of the power held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in favor of a traditional staff structure. He has rarely fully empowered people in the jobs they hold.
‚ÄúPart of this is President Trump being Donald J. Trump, the same guy he‚Äôs always been, and part of it is a government he has now molded in his image, rather than having a government as it has traditionally been, to serve the chief executive, and to serve the job of governing the country,‚Äù said David Lapan, a former spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon, and a former aide of Mr. Kelly.
Health officials order millions in the Bay Area to ‚Äúshelter in place.‚Äù
Six counties in Northern California have ordered all residents to ‚Äúshelter in place‚Äù in an effort to stop the coronavirus from surging.
The order, which takes effect Tuesday, is expected to disrupt life for millions of residents in Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara counties. The city of Berkeley also issued the same order.
That means staying at home except for the most essential reasons. Officials said people would be allowed to leave the house for essential work, to go to a grocery store, pick up medication, or even walk the dog. But they urged everyone to practice social distancing while outside. ‚ÄúIt is now time to do your part,‚Äù Dr. Scott Morrow, the San Mateo health officer, said in a statement.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs asking people to go home with their families and to stay there until they are told otherwise,‚Äù said Mayor Joe Goethals of San Mateo, adding that only ‚Äúessential‚Äù businesses like hospitals, grocery stores and pharmacies would remain open.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt expect anyone to get arrested,‚Äù said Mr. Goethals, who said people will still be allowed to go outside for limited activities, like buying food and getting fresh air. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not optional. This is mandatory for all of us.‚Äù
The number of coronavirus cases in the United States crossed the 4,000 mark on Monday, with more than 70 deaths, including the first deaths in Indiana, Nevada and South Carolina.
A growing number of cities and states have taken significant actions to slow the coronavirus, shutting down schools, restaurants, bars, movie theaters and gyms. The restrictions stretched from the now-empty sidewalks of New York City, where officials had made the wrenching decision to shut down public schools, to the fields and urban centers of Ohio. Millions of Americans are now hunkered down at home for the foreseeable future.
France imposes a nationwide lockdown.
Declaring ‚Äúwe are at war,‚Äù President Emmanuel Macron of France prohibited public gatherings of any size, postponed municipal elections and told people to stay in their homes except for essential needs.
His order, which goes into effect on Tuesday, is one of the most stringent anywhere in Europe. Officials said that going out for a walk to get some fresh air would be allowed, but meeting a friend on a street or in a park would be punishable with a fine.
Christophe Castaner, the interior minister, said anyone on a public outing would need to carry a document justifying it, even if only a sworn statement written by that person. He said that 100,000 law enforcement officers would be deployed to enforce the order.
Olivier V√©ran, France‚Äôs health minister, said that the government was asking each French person to limit human contact to a maximum of five people a day. France, with more than 6,600 coronavirus cases and 148 deaths by Monday, had already ordered all ‚Äúnon-indispensable‚Äù businesses closed.
‚ÄúWe will be able to end the confinement,‚Äù Mr. V√©ran said in a post on Twitter. ‚ÄúBut without confinement, we will not be able to end the epidemic.‚Äù
Spain, with almost 10,000 cases and more than 300 deaths by Monday, also ordered residents to mostly stay at home, though it is still allowing most people to go to work and has not announced any punitive measures. Schools, restaurants and bars were ordered to close.
The pace of new coronavirus infections reported in Europe accelerates daily ‚Äî roughly 6,000 on Thursday, 7,000 on Friday, 8,000 on Saturday, 9,000 on Sunday and 10,000 on Monday, bringing the total to about 62,000. France and Spain warned that their health care systems could be overwhelmed.
And in Italy, still the hardest-hit country in Europe and the first to impose nationwide restrictions on movement, the government announced $28 billion in emergency aid to individuals, businesses and the health care system to stave off chaos and financial ruin.
Italy had almost 28,000 infections and more than 1,800 deaths as of Monday.The government‚Äôs aid package delays mortgage, loan and tax payments, and offers extended parental leave, sick leave for people in quarantine, babysitting vouchers, and grants for self-employed and seasonal workers.
‚ÄúWe never considered fighting a flood with buckets,‚Äù Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said. ‚ÄúWe are trying to build a dam to protect businesses, families and workers.‚Äù
Ohio governor ignores court ruling and postpones Tuesday‚Äôs primary.
Ohio‚Äôs governor on Monday night said he and top state heath officials would ignore a court ruling and postpone Ohio‚Äôs presidential primary by declaring a public health emergency because of the coronavirus outbreak.
The governor, Mike DeWine, said that the state‚Äôs health director, Dr. Amy Acton, had issued the order based on concerns that the coronavirus outbreak placed both voters and poll workers in potential danger.
His announcement came just hours after Judge Richard A. Frye of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas rejected the state‚Äôs request to push back voting to June 2.
Ohio was one of four states scheduled to vote on Tuesday. The other three ‚Äî Arizona, Illinois and Florida ‚Äî said that they planned to proceed with their elections while taking additional health precautions.
Kentucky also announced that it was delaying its primary.
U.S. airlines ask for $50 billion in emergency support from the government.
The lobbying group for America‚Äôs biggest airlines called on the government on Monday to provide more than $50 billion in grants, loan guarantees and tax relief. The group, Airlines for America, warned that the current situation was not sustainable for the industry and that there was no end in sight to the crisis.
‚ÄúThis is a today problem, not a tomorrow problem,‚Äù said Nicholas E. Calio, chief executive of Airlines for America. ‚ÄúIt requires urgent action.‚Äù
The industry group said that flight cancellations are outpacing new bookings and that the decline in demand is getting worse by the day. The request included $25 billion in grants for passenger carriers, $4 billion in grants for cargo, $25 billion in loan guarantees.
On Sunday, United Airlines executives said they were in talks with union leaders about reducing payroll costs. The moves being considered include furloughs, pay cuts and reducing minimum hours.
United‚Äôs corporate officers will be taking a 50 percent pay cut, Oscar Munoz, the chief executive, and Scott Kirby, the president, said in a letter. Both have already said they would forgo their base salaries through June.
Reversing course, Britain says to avoid travel and contact with people.
In a sharp reversal, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday that everyone should avoid unnecessary travel and contact with others, should work at home and should stop going to places like bars, restaurants and theaters.
Mr. Johnson called the measures ‚Äúvery draconian,‚Äù but he stopped well short of the kinds of steps taken by some harder-hit European countries. He did not order schools or businesses closed, did not tell people to stay in their homes, and said the steps were not mandatory, but rather ‚Äúgiving very strong advice.‚Äù
Mr. Johnson and his government had faced harsh criticism for its laissez-faire approach to the pandemic. They had spoken hopefully of ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù ‚Äî in which many people would be infected, recover and then, it is hoped, be immune ‚Äî while it was inevitable that many people would take ill and die.
But at a news conference on Monday with top medical officials, he said: ‚ÄúNow is the time for everyone to stop nonessential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel.‚Äù
In particular, people over 70 and those with serious illnesses should avoid contact with others, Mr. Johnson said, suggesting that as a result, people should not visit nursing and retirement homes.
The English actor Idris Elba, who was in the HBO series ‚ÄúThe Wire,‚Äù announced on Monday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, sharing the news with fans in a video that he posted on Twitter.
‚ÄúTransparency is probably the best thing for this right now,‚Äù said Mr. Elba, 47. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre feeling ill or you feel like you should be tested or you‚Äôve been exposed, then do something about it. It‚Äôs really important.‚Äù

A growing number of cities and states have taken significant actions to slow the coronavirus, shutting down schools, restaurants, bars, movie theaters and gyms. The restrictions stretched from the now-empty sidewalks of New York City, where officials had made the wrenching decision to shut down public schools, to the fields and urban centers of Ohio. Millions of Americans are now hunkered down at home for the foreseeable future. France imposes a nationwide lockdown. Declaring ‚Äúwe are at war,‚Äù President Emmanuel Macron of France prohibited public gatherings of any size, postponed municipal elections and told people to stay in their homes except for essential needs. His order, which goes into effect on Tuesday, is one of the most stringent anywhere in Europe. Officials said that going out for a walk to get some fresh air would be allowed, but meeting a friend on a street or in a park would be punishable with a fine. Christophe Castaner, the interior minister, said anyone on a public outing would need to carry a document justifying it, even if only a sworn statement written by that person. He said that 100,000 law enforcement officers would be deployed to enforce the order. Olivier V√©ran, France‚Äôs health minister, said that the government was asking each French person to limit human contact to a maximum of five people a day. France, with more than 6,600 coronavirus cases and 148 deaths by Monday, had already ordered all ‚Äúnon-indispensable‚Äù businesses closed. ‚ÄúWe will be able to end the confinement,‚Äù Mr. V√©ran said in a post on Twitter. ‚ÄúBut without confinement, we will not be able to end the epidemic.‚Äù Spain, with almost 10,000 cases and more than 300 deaths by Monday, also ordered residents to mostly stay at home, though it is still allowing most people to go to work and has not announced any punitive measures. Schools, restaurants and bars were ordered to close. The pace of new coronavirus infections reported in Europe accelerates daily ‚Äî roughly 6,000 on Thursday, 7,000 on Friday, 8,000 on Saturday, 9,000 on Sunday and 10,000 on Monday, bringing the total to about 62,000. France and Spain warned that their health care systems could be overwhelmed. And in Italy, still the hardest-hit country in Europe and the first to impose nationwide restrictions on movement, the government announced $28 billion in emergency aid to individuals, businesses and the health care system to stave off chaos and financial ruin. Italy had almost 28,000 infections and more than 1,800 deaths as of Monday.The government‚Äôs aid package delays mortgage, loan and tax payments, and offers extended parental leave, sick leave for people in quarantine, babysitting vouchers, and grants for self-employed and seasonal workers. ‚ÄúWe never considered fighting a flood with buckets,‚Äù Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said. ‚ÄúWe are trying to build a dam to protect businesses, families and workers.‚Äù Ohio governor ignores court ruling and postpones Tuesday‚Äôs primary. Ohio‚Äôs governor on Monday night said he and top state heath officials would ignore a court ruling and postpone Ohio‚Äôs presidential primary by declaring a public health emergency because of the coronavirus outbreak. The governor, Mike DeWine, said that the state‚Äôs health director, Dr. Amy Acton, had issued the order based on concerns that the coronavirus outbreak placed both voters and poll workers in potential danger. His announcement came just hours after Judge Richard A. Frye of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas rejected the state‚Äôs request to push back voting to June 2. Ohio was one of four states scheduled to vote on Tuesday. The other three ‚Äî Arizona, Illinois and Florida ‚Äî said that they planned to proceed with their elections while taking additional health precautions. Kentucky also announced that it was delaying its primary. U.S. airlines ask for $50 billion in emergency support from the government. The lobbying group for America‚Äôs biggest airlines called on the government on Monday to provide more than $50 billion in grants, loan guarantees and tax relief. The group, Airlines for America, warned that the current situation was not sustainable for the industry and that there was no end in sight to the crisis. ‚ÄúThis is a today problem, not a tomorrow problem,‚Äù said Nicholas E. Calio, chief executive of Airlines for America. ‚ÄúIt requires urgent action.‚Äù The industry group said that flight cancellations are outpacing new bookings and that the decline in demand is getting worse by the day. The request included $25 billion in grants for passenger carriers, $4 billion in grants for cargo, $25 billion in loan guarantees. On Sunday, United Airlines executives said they were in talks with union leaders about reducing payroll costs. The moves being considered include furloughs, pay cuts and reducing minimum hours. United‚Äôs corporate officers will be taking a 50 percent pay cut, Oscar Munoz, the chief executive, and Scott Kirby, the president, said in a letter. Both have already said they would forgo their base salaries through June. Reversing course, Britain says to avoid travel and contact with people. In a sharp reversal, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday that everyone should avoid unnecessary travel and contact with others, should work at home and should stop going to places like bars, restaurants and theaters. Mr. Johnson called the measures ‚Äúvery draconian,‚Äù but he stopped well short of the kinds of steps taken by some harder-hit European countries. He did not order schools or businesses closed, did not tell people to stay in their homes, and said the steps were not mandatory, but rather ‚Äúgiving very strong advice.‚Äù Mr. Johnson and his government had faced harsh criticism for its laissez-faire approach to the pandemic. They had spoken hopefully of ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù ‚Äî in which many people would be infected, recover and then, it is hoped, be immune ‚Äî while it was inevitable that many people would take ill and die. But at a news conference on Monday with top medical officials, he said: ‚ÄúNow is the time for everyone to stop nonessential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel.‚Äù In particular, people over 70 and those with serious illnesses should avoid contact with others, Mr. Johnson said, suggesting that as a result, people should not visit nursing and retirement homes. The English actor Idris Elba, who was in the HBO series ‚ÄúThe Wire,‚Äù announced on Monday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, sharing the news with fans in a video that he posted on Twitter. ‚ÄúTransparency is probably the best thing for this right now,‚Äù said Mr. Elba, 47. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre feeling ill or you feel like you should be tested or you‚Äôve been exposed, then do something about it. It‚Äôs really important.‚Äù Reporting was contributed by Michael Powell, Elisabetta Povoledo, Tim Arango, Thomas Fuller, John Eligon, Maya Salam, Conor Dougherty, Jim Tankersley, Niraj Chokshi, Matina Stevis-Gridneff, Ian Austen, Catie Edmondson, Peter Baker, Katie Robertson, Jonathan Martin, Michael Cooper, Karen Weise, Reid J.

Then the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the city and his son‚Äôs day care center but not Atkins‚Äô job as an essential worker. After being reassigned to a midday shift that ends at 9 pm, he‚Äôs scrambled to find child care, leaning heavily on his mom and aunt.

Even clad in a jumpsuit, gloves and mask, his line of work carries health risks and he‚Äôs fearful of bringing home the deadly virus to the two-family flat he shares with his son, mother and younger sister. And, fiercely protective of his young charge, he wonders whether his son should return to day care when Michigan reopens.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs overwhelming. I try not to focus on it,‚Äù Atkins says. ‚ÄúI just hope and pray for the best.‚Äù

What schools will look like when they reopen:Scheduled days home, more online learning, lots of hand-washing

When will schools reopen?:Not soon, education leaders say, despite Trump's declarations

The push to reboot the nation‚Äôs economy is leaving millions of parents like Atkins in a tough bind. They can‚Äôt go back to work without someone to care for their children, whether preschools or day care facilities, babysitters or relatives. And, even if they can find child care, they‚Äôre worried states are moving too quickly and may be putting their kids‚Äô lives at risk.

Last week the Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected an extension of the state‚Äôs stay-at-home order. In some places, employees are being called back to work before child care facilities open.

Lack of child care is quickly emerging as one of the biggest barriers to the economy bouncing back, says Patricia Cole, senior director of federal policy for Zero to Three, a nonprofit focused on early childhood development.

‚ÄúChild care is foundational to our nation‚Äôs ability to recover from this crisis,‚Äù Cole said during a news briefing put on by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

COVID-19 plunges child care system into crisis

COVID-19 has plunged the child care industry, 90% of which is privately run, into a crisis the likes of which the nation has never seen.

Already child care centers were expensive to operate and stayed afloat on meager profits. Caregivers and other staffers, a third of whom have been laid off, often get by on poverty wages and public assistance, unable to afford child care for their own children.

Now child care advocates argue the nation‚Äôs already fragile system is at risk of collapse. They are lobbying for billions more in federal aid to ensure reliable child care is available to parents.

Though in many places they were not required to close, since the pandemic began, nearly half of child care facilities nationwide have shut down, some of them indefinitely as the coronavirus forced families to keep kids at home, according to a survey of child care providers conducted by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC).

Seventeen percent of providers have closed to everyone except the children of essential personnel. Of the facilities which have remained open, 85% are operating at less than 50% of enrollment capacity and the majority of those are operating at less than 25% of capacity, the survey conducted in April found.

‚ÄúWe don't fully know yet who are the child care providers and facilities that are not going to have survived this economic crisis because they just couldn't keep the doors open,‚Äù says Javaid Siddiqi, CEO of The Hunt Institute, an education nonprofit in Cary, North Carolina.

It‚Äôs also unclear how many providers will be able to afford to reopen or at what capacity with strict new health protocols that vary from state to state. Some new rules limit the number of children that can be in any group ‚Äì and in many cases require the same children and adults be placed together every day. Child care centers also face higher costs for additional staffing, personal protective equipment, hand sanitizer and cleaning supplies.

Summer camps and programs have also fallen on hard times and are being driven out of business. The ones still standing are trying to figure out if or how they can reopen safely.

Half of facilities closed, remaining providers stretched

Child care providers that have remained open to watch over the children of essential workers are stretched to the breaking point.

Crystal Perry-Grant, a 38-year-old mother of three, runs a family day care in Perris, California, a small city in Riverside County. For 12-hour stretches with the help of her 17-year-old daughter, she cares for eight children whose parents are essential workers from firefighters to UPS workers, ranging in age from 1 to 9.

School-age kids learn remotely on six computers that routinely slow her Wi-Fi to a crawl. She cooks homemade soups from fresh farm produce to boost their immune systems. Hand sanitizer squirted liberally throughout the day into little palms has kept sickness at bay. In the past two months, she hasn‚Äôt had even a single runny nose.

‚ÄúOur parents need us. They don‚Äôt have family around. It‚Äôs a dire need. I would feel bad if I closed,‚Äù Perry-Grant says. ‚ÄúNo one had a job they could up and quit, so I couldn‚Äôt either.‚Äù

But Perry-Grant can‚Äôt take on any more children. She has no openings and a long waiting list.

‚ÄúThis goes very much to the heart of whether we are going to be able to just reopen the economy,‚Äù says Michael Madowitz, an economist at the Center for American Progress who studies the child care industry. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of reasons why we can't just flip a switch and this is very high on the list.‚Äù

For Demetriss ‚ÄúDemi‚Äù DeShazior, a 41-year-old medical assistant in Miami, child care tops her list of concerns.

Her mother babysat her 2-year-old while DeShazior languished on a long waiting list for partially subsidized child care. When she was seven months pregnant, DeShazior learned she‚Äôd secured a spot, but this was a month before the pandemic hit. Before she could finish filling out the paperwork, child care facilities closed.

So DeShazior took family medical leave earlier than she planned in March to stay home with her son. Now she's applying for child care for her toddler and 5-week-old as an essential health worker but her unease is growing.

‚ÄúIf I do return to work, will my babies be safe from contracting COVID-19 at day care?"" DeShazior wonders. ‚ÄúWill I even have day care covered for both babies by my return date?‚Äù

Nation cannot reopen with kids still at home

Even before the coronavirus tore across the country, parents scrambled to find child care. With too few spots to meet demand, the burden fell heaviest on low-wage parents, women and families of color. Now millions more spots may have evaporated.

Traditional backstops such as grandparents who used to step in to care for children while parents worked belong to populations most vulnerable to the coronavirus.

‚ÄúMost states are talking about child care, but there‚Äôs a mixed bag in terms of how many are actually being planful about it. When you as a state say, ‚Äòwe‚Äôre open,‚Äô but then you don‚Äôt give guidance around child care, that puts the burden of the situation on families,‚Äù says NAEYC's CEO Rhian Evans Allvin. And that, Allvin, says, ‚Äúexacerbates the already existing inequities in early childhood education because inherently wealthier families have more options.‚Äù

As more parents prepare to return to work, the enormousness of the challenge facing the nation‚Äôs patchwork child care system is staggering.

Four in 10 working adults have children under 18. Nearly 60% of children under 5 participated in regular weekly care arrangements and a third were enrolled in a child care program of some kind before the coronavirus struck. Yet, with many child care providers from small family day cares to after-school programs closing up shop indefinitely, parents are at loose ends.

‚ÄúParents who are being called back into work at this point really may find challenges in securing care or even, in some cases, securing the care they were accustomed to,‚Äù says Dan Wuori, director of early learning at The Hunt Institute, which has a database tracking state child care policies.

Among those parents is Laura Byrd, 35, a human resources generalist from Newark, New Jersey and mother of a 7-year-old who‚Äôs been working from home since the start of the pandemic.

‚ÄúOur ‚Äònew normal‚Äô will pose some difficulties once I am instructed to return to the office. As the state reopens, our day care centers and summer camps will not be operating which will create child care issues for me,‚Äù says Byrd, who‚Äôs considering taking a leave of absence if necessary.

Agonizing choices between health risks and paychecks

Reopening is forcing parents in Georgia, Florida and other states into an agonizing choice between potentially risking their health and the health of their children and earning a paycheck.

Late at night and in the early morning hours, Christy Moreno, 39, a bilingual editorial director, squeezes a stress ball while sending work emails from her Kansas City, Missouri, home.

Her makeshift office is a small round table in the corner of her dining room covered in stray crayons and device chargers. This single mother of two, ages 10 and 13, balances overseeing her children‚Äôs education and counseling Latino parents working in hotels and restaurants on how to find child care. On social media, parent groups are overflowing with worry and confusion: What are families supposed to do?

Anxieties are running especially high for parents whose children have health conditions that put them at higher risk for the coronavirus. Many can‚Äôt afford lower-risk options such as babysitters and nannies or having one parent stay home. These parents say even if they can find child care, they don‚Äôt know if they should send their kids. Some employees can take sick leave or expanded family and medical leave if they are caring for a child when schools and day care centers are closed under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which was signed into law in March, but not everyone has that option.

‚ÄúParents are being forced into this Catch-22,‚Äù says Keri Rodrigues, founding president of the National Parents Union, a network of parent organizations across the country. ‚ÄúThey feel a desperate need to go back to work but at the same time they are terrified of this deadly virus.‚Äù

Parents worry: Is it safe to send kids back to child care?

Laid off in March, Rachel Jean-Pierre is a single mother of two in Union, New Jersey. If she‚Äôs called back to her job in New York City as a guest service manager in July, she will have to find a family member to help care for her children, ages 6 and 9, both of whom have asthma.

‚ÄúWith the government reopening the economy with no confirmed solution to this pandemic, I am torn between wanting my children to return to their normal schedules and wanting to keep them safe,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúUntil the country has really grabbed hold of this pandemic, as a parent with children who suffer from asthma, I would rather be safe than sorry.‚Äù

Conflicting messages have not helped parents make these tough calls. While President Donald Trump pushes governors to work to reopen schools, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned in Senate testimony last week, ""We don't know everything about this virus and we really better be pretty careful, particularly when it comes to children.""

It‚Äôs week 11 of quarantine for Naomi Nedd, a 49-year-old mother and contract negotiator for a managed care plan in Queens. She‚Äôs resorted to bribing her 3-year-old son with gummy bears and screen time when she has to write a contract or jump on a Zoom call. Once he falls asleep at 7:30 pm, she digs in for hours to make a dent in her workload.

‚ÄúI went into this thinking, my kid is home, it will be fine. But it‚Äôs so different when you are trying to be the professional you are when you‚Äôve left your child at day care than when you are at a dining room table with a 3-year-old who just knows you‚Äôre mommy,‚Äù Nedd says.

Her son is supposed to start a summer program in July and preschool in the fall, but her heart races just thinking about it. The ravages of the coronavirus are all around her at the epicenter of the New York outbreak. Children her son‚Äôs age don‚Äôt know how to socially distance.

‚ÄúI don't care what opens up, if my gut feels like it isn‚Äôt safe, we will have to figure out a way to continue to make it work at home,‚Äù Nedd says.

In Boston, Yahaira Lopez, a 41-year-old mother of 10-year-old twins, one with ADHD, the other with autism, was recently laid off from her job on a mobile crisis team performing mental health risk assessments. She‚Äôs struggling to be a substitute teacher to her two fourth graders, run Autism Sprinter, her nonprofit that helps the families and caregivers of children who are on the spectrum, and figure out how she‚Äôll afford rent and utilities.

Schools are closed, summer programs are up in the air and Massachusetts has not yet reopened child care centers, she says. Even when these programs restart, Lopez says she‚Äôs not sure she will send her kids. Both of her sons have severe asthma.

‚ÄúI would probably be very scared to send my children to any form of child care or after school program,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúor, to be honest with you, even back to school into what may be overcrowded classrooms.‚Äù",Center,USA,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Coronavirus child care crisis tops concerns as nation pushes to reopen.

Half of facilities closed, remaining providers stretched  Child care providers that have remained open to watch over the children of essential workers are stretched to the breaking point.  Crystal Perry-Grant, a 38-year-old mother of three, runs a family day care in Perris, California, a small city in Riverside County. For 12-hour stretches with the help of her 17-year-old daughter, she cares for eight children whose parents are essential workers from firefighters to UPS workers, ranging in age from 1 to 9.  School-age kids learn remotely on six computers that routinely slow her Wi-Fi to a crawl. She cooks homemade soups from fresh farm produce to boost their immune systems. Hand sanitizer squirted liberally throughout the day into little palms has kept sickness at bay. In the past two months, she hasn‚Äôt had even a single runny nose.  ‚ÄúOur parents need us. They don‚Äôt have family around. It‚Äôs a dire need. I would feel bad if I closed,‚Äù Perry-Grant says. ‚ÄúNo one had a job they could up and quit, so I couldn‚Äôt either.‚Äù  But Perry-Grant can‚Äôt take on any more children. She has no openings and a long waiting list.  ‚ÄúThis goes very much to the heart of whether we are going to be able to just reopen the economy,‚Äù says Michael Madowitz, an economist at the Center for American Progress who studies the child care industry. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of reasons why we can't just flip a switch and this is very high on the list.‚Äù  For Demetriss ‚ÄúDemi‚Äù DeShazior, a 41-year-old medical assistant in Miami, child care tops her list of concerns.  Her mother babysat her 2-year-old while DeShazior languished on a long waiting list for partially subsidized child care. When she was seven months pregnant, DeShazior learned she‚Äôd secured a spot, but this was a month before the pandemic hit. Before she could finish filling out the paperwork, child care facilities closed.  So DeShazior took family medical leave earlier than she planned in March to stay home with her son. Now she's applying for child care for her toddler and 5-week-old as an essential health worker but her unease is growing.  ‚ÄúIf I do return to work, will my babies be safe from contracting COVID-19 at day care?"" DeShazior wonders. ‚ÄúWill I even have day care covered for both babies by my return date?‚Äù  Nation cannot reopen with kids still at home  Even before the coronavirus tore across the country, parents scrambled to find child care. With too few spots to meet demand, the burden fell heaviest on low-wage parents, women and families of color. Now millions more spots may have evaporated.  Traditional backstops such as grandparents who used to step in to care for children while parents worked belong to populations most vulnerable to the coronavirus.  ‚ÄúMost states are talking about child care, but there‚Äôs a mixed bag in terms of how many are actually being planful about it. When you as a state say, ‚Äòwe‚Äôre open,‚Äô but then you don‚Äôt give guidance around child care, that puts the burden of the situation on families,‚Äù says NAEYC's CEO Rhian Evans Allvin. And that, Allvin, says, ‚Äúexacerbates the already existing inequities in early childhood education because inherently wealthier families have more options.‚Äù  As more parents prepare to return to work, the enormousness of the challenge facing the nation‚Äôs patchwork child care system is staggering.  Four in 10 working adults have children under 18. Nearly 60% of children under 5 participated in regular weekly care arrangements and a third were enrolled in a child care program of some kind before the coronavirus struck. Yet, with many child care providers from small family day cares to after-school programs closing up shop indefinitely, parents are at loose ends.  ‚ÄúParents who are being called back into work at this point really may find challenges in securing care or even, in some cases, securing the care they were accustomed to,‚Äù says Dan Wuori, director of early learning at The Hunt Institute, which has a database tracking state child care policies.  Among those parents is Laura Byrd, 35, a human resources generalist from Newark, New Jersey and mother of a 7-year-old who‚Äôs been working from home since the start of the pandemic.  ‚ÄúOur ‚Äònew normal‚Äô will pose some difficulties once I am instructed to return to the office. As the state reopens, our day care centers and summer camps will not be operating which will create child care issues for me,‚Äù says Byrd, who‚Äôs considering taking a leave of absence if necessary.  Agonizing choices between health risks and paychecks  Reopening is forcing parents in Georgia, Florida and other states into an agonizing choice between potentially risking their health and the health of their children and earning a paycheck.  Late at night and in the early morning hours, Christy Moreno, 39, a bilingual editorial director, squeezes a stress ball while sending work emails from her Kansas City, Missouri, home.  Her makeshift office is a small round table in the corner of her dining room covered in stray crayons and device chargers. This single mother of two, ages 10 and 13, balances overseeing her children‚Äôs education and counseling Latino parents working in hotels and restaurants on how to find child care. On social media, parent groups are overflowing with worry and confusion: What are families supposed to do?  Anxieties are running especially high for parents whose children have health conditions that put them at higher risk for the coronavirus. Many can‚Äôt afford lower-risk options such as babysitters and nannies or having one parent stay home. These parents say even if they can find child care, they don‚Äôt know if they should send their kids. Some employees can take sick leave or expanded family and medical leave if they are caring for a child when schools and day care centers are closed under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which was signed into law in March, but not everyone has that option.  ‚ÄúParents are being forced into this Catch-22,‚Äù says Keri Rodrigues, founding president of the National Parents Union, a network of parent organizations across the country. ‚ÄúThey feel a desperate need to go back to work but at the same time they are terrified of this deadly virus.‚Äù  Parents worry: Is it safe to send kids back to child care?  Laid off in March, Rachel Jean-Pierre is a single mother of two in Union, New Jersey. If she‚Äôs called back to her job in New York City as a guest service manager in July, she will have to find a family member to help care for her children, ages 6 and 9, both of whom have asthma.  ‚ÄúWith the government reopening the economy with no confirmed solution to this pandemic, I am torn between wanting my children to return to their normal schedules and wanting to keep them safe,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúUntil the country has really grabbed hold of this pandemic, as a parent with children who suffer from asthma, I would rather be safe than sorry.‚Äù  Conflicting messages have not helped parents make these tough calls. While President Donald Trump pushes governors to work to reopen schools, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned in Senate testimony last week, ""We don't know everything about this virus and we really better be pretty careful, particularly when it comes to children.""  It‚Äôs week 11 of quarantine for Naomi Nedd, a 49-year-old mother and contract negotiator for a managed care plan in Queens. She‚Äôs resorted to bribing her 3-year-old son with gummy bears and screen time when she has to write a contract or jump on a Zoom call. Once he falls asleep at 7:30 pm, she digs in for hours to make a dent in her workload.  ‚ÄúI went into this thinking, my kid is home, it will be fine. But it‚Äôs so different when you are trying to be the professional you are when you‚Äôve left your child at day care than when you are at a dining room table with a 3-year-old who just knows you‚Äôre mommy,‚Äù Nedd says.  Her son is supposed to start a summer program in July and preschool in the fall, but her heart races just thinking about it. The ravages of the coronavirus are all around her at the epicenter of the New York outbreak. Children her son‚Äôs age don‚Äôt know how to socially distance.  ‚ÄúI don't care what opens up, if my gut feels like it isn‚Äôt safe, we will have to figure out a way to continue to make it work at home,‚Äù Nedd says.  In Boston, Yahaira Lopez, a 41-year-old mother of 10-year-old twins, one with ADHD, the other with autism, was recently laid off from her job on a mobile crisis team performing mental health risk assessments. She‚Äôs struggling to be a substitute teacher to her two fourth graders, run Autism Sprinter, her nonprofit that helps the families and caregivers of children who are on the spectrum, and figure out how she‚Äôll afford rent and utilities.  Schools are closed, summer programs are up in the air and Massachusetts has not yet reopened child care centers, she says. Even when these programs restart, Lopez says she‚Äôs not sure she will send her kids. Both of her sons have severe asthma.  ‚ÄúI would probably be very scared to send my children to any form of child care or after school program,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúor, to be honest with you, even back to school into what may be overcrowded classrooms.‚Äù"

Here's what it means.",https://i.insider.com/5ebd67e5cea43700ee074598?width=1200&format=jpeg,"According to a report from Douglas Elliman, Manhattan's rental market saw the number of new leases drop to a record low in April compared to the same time last year.

However, both Manhattan's non-luxury and luxury market market also saw an increase in median rent.

In addition, Brooklyn and Queens also saw increases in median rent and huge drops in the number of new listings.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

In the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, many Manhattan renters have opted to renew their leases for the year as they continue to follow stay-at-home orders.

In fact, according to an April market report from Douglas Elliman, the number of new leases in Manhattan saw a 70.9% year-over-year decrease to 1,407. According to the report, that is the lowest number of new leases recorded in a decade and the largest percent decline ever recorded.

The Elliman report credits that decline to the coronavirus pandemic, stating that ""new leasing activity declined at record rates due to the COVID-19 shutdown, while the market share of lease renewals surged as tenants sought relief,""

In addition, the report found that the April vacancy rate, which was 2.42%, was the highest recorded in at least 14 years.

But Manhattan's median rent price actually rose in the midst of these declines, and was up 4.9% compared to April 2019, to $3,650. The rental price per square foot was up 9% to $74.20.

Like the non-luxury market, Manhattan's luxury market saw a drastic year-over-year drop in the number of new leases, down 71.1% compared to April 2019.

And, like the non-luxury market, the median rent for the higher end also saw a year-over-year increase, up 5.5% to $8,650.

Queens and Brooklyn saw a similar April fate

Both Brooklyn and Queens saw the number of new leases in April drop by more than 60% compared to the same time last year.

In Queens, the number of new leases fell by 64.9% to 100, and in Brooklyn, the number of new leases fell 66.8% to 439.

""The record decline in new leasing activity due to the Coronavirus crisis indicated that renewal activity was where the weakness in rental price trends could be found,"" the report reads.

""Renewal leasing activity surged in response to the sharp drop in new leasing activity caused by COVID-19 shelter in place rules, skewing aggregate new leasing price trends higher,""

But, like Manhattan, both markets saw a year-over year increase in the median rent price.

In Queens, the median rental price rose by 4.2% to $2970. And in Brooklyn, the median rental price shot up 14.4% to $3,259, a new record, according to the report.

The rental market still faces obstacles, such as rent strikes, as the pandemic drags on

As of May 6, 80.2% of apartment households were able to make full or partial rent payments.

To arrive at that percentage, the National Multifamily Housing Council's Rent Payment Tracker surveyed 11.4 million units of professionally managed apartment units across the US.

The tracker found that May's 80.2% was an improvement on April, which saw 78% of rents paid, and a slight decrease from 81.7% in May 2019.

According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, the unexpectedly high amount of renters able to make payments in May points to the effectiveness of stimulus checks and expanded unemployment benefits, but some fear that won't continue to be enough.

If policy makers don't address the stress renters are under because of the pandemic, mass evictions, deteriorating housing stock, and a real estate or housing market crash are all at stake, a report by the Urban Institute predicts.

""We argue that there is a need for a national rental assistance program. None of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act programs provide that,"" the report reads.

The hashtags #CancelRent and #CantPayMay have been trending on Twitter in response to the growing unemployment rate.

The unofficial start of summer is just over a week away!

But unfortunately, summer is canceled. Not to mention, the window to take advantage of cheap gas for your road trip is closing fast.

In Wisconsin ‚Äî where gas was as low as 87 cents just weeks ago ‚Äî the bottom is now up to a whopping $1.44. Who can even afford that?

Rising gas prices are just one sign that oil markets are starting to recover, in step with global oil demand. That's great news for an industry that faced one of the worst springs in history.

Now we're starting to ask: What will the energy industry look like when the pandemic is in the rearview?

For starters, we asked a bunch of CEOs.

We had the pleasure of interviewing eight top energy execs ‚Äî from BP's Susan Dio to Duke Energy's Lynn Good ‚Äî about how the coronavirus will change their companies and the industry at large.

Theme 1: The transition to low-carbon energy remains at center stage even as majors slash their budgets. 2020 forecasts aside, the pandemic won't do much to slow it down.

Theme 2: People are craving energy resilience, especially as wildfire and hurricane seasons draw near. That could give residential solar and infrastructure projects a boost.

Here are a few of the comments that stood out to me. You can read all of them here.

""California had one of the driest months of February in its history, and because of COVID-19, we've seen reports of fewer prescribed burns, which increases the risk of wildfires this fall,"" Sunrun's CEO Lynn Jurich said.

""We have a wire or a pipe connected to businesses in every county of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan,"" CMS Energy's CEO Patti Poppe said. ""The question for us in the midterm is how will those businesses come back.""

""We are a little bit worried about the electrification of transportation right now because I think the transportation sector is suffering a lot,"" Energy Impact Partners' CEO Hans Kobler said. ""Electric vehicle sales will be down 40%.""

I don't know what I'm eating for lunch or where I'll be living in two months, let alone what the world will look like in 20 years.

But if anyone is up for the task of predicting the future of energy, it's analysts at the research firm Wood Mackenzie. This week, they sketched out three paths that a recovery could take, and what each means for energy.

""Full recovery"": A coronavirus vaccine becomes available next year, and governments around the world pour money into spurring economic growth.

Oil demand returns to pre-pandemic levels of around 100 million barrels per day (bpd) in the 2020s and then reaches a peak of more than 110 million bpd by the mid-2030s.

Natural gas and cheap renewable energy sources would slowly replace coal, causing it to decline slightly by 2040.

""Go it alone"": The virus is tough to defeat, trade and travel are restricted, and the world suffers from a long recession.

Global demand for oil increases very little after an initial rebound.

""By 2030 it is barely any higher than was expected for 2020 if the pandemic had not hit,"" they said.

""Greener growth"": A short recession is followed by a strong rebound that includes government support for low-carbon energy.

Oil demand wouldn't move much for the next decade or so and then decline steeply in the 2030s.

Most remarkably, ""the combined share of oil, gas, and coal in total primary energy drops to 68% in 2040, down from 84% in 2019,"" the analysts said.

Oil prices have rallied in recent weeks, but the US shale industry ‚Äî once synonymous with American energy dominance ‚Äî is not exactly celebrating.

As we reported earlier this week, its problems began well before the coronavirus pandemic took root.

History lesson: In the last five years, US shale companies have failed to deliver investor returns and accrued billions of dollars of debt.

Investors made a lot of money when they invested on ""the dip"" around 2009, when oil prices were low.

Those investors helped fuel the fracking revolution of the 2010s, which supercharged America's oil output.

An unintended consequence was that fracking brought M&A ‚Äî the main source of capital gains for investors ‚Äî to a near standstill over the following years. (I explain why here.)

So when investors once again backed US shale in the last downturn, beginning around 2014, they never saw returns.

Where we are now: Of the 500 or so US oil and gas companies backed by private equity, about 400 of them don't have bids, according to an investor who's been tracking the industry for years.

That means they'll be forced to go into what he called ""blowdown"" ‚Äî diverting cash from production to investors, causing oil output to decline over time.

US production could fall by as much as 4 million barrels of oil per day by the end of next year, the investor said.

Where we are headed: ""What you're seeing is the rapid shrinkage of the industry,"" he said. ""A lot of companies are going to cease to exist.""

Andrew Cuomo said that 66% of new hospitalizations in New York for Covid-19 were people who had been staying home. ""This is a surprise: Overwhelmingly, the people were at home,"" Cuomo said. ""We thought maybe they were taking public transportation, and we've taken special precautions on public transportation, but actually no, because these people were literally at home."" The ""shocking"" data came from a survey of more than 100 New York hospitals and about 1,300 new patients, Cuomo said. It raises the question: ""Of the people who are staying home, how rigorously are they staying at home?"" Stephen Morse, professor of epidemiology at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, who focuses on risk assessment of infectious diseases, tells CNBC Make It. It's possible that as we enter the ninth and tenth week of fairly extreme prevention measures, people are feeling fatigued or getting too relaxed, says Joseph Vinetz, professor of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine and physician scientist in infectious diseases. ""Just because we're tired doesn't mean that the virus cares,"" he says. ""Viruses have no emotions; they just do their thing."" According to Cuomo, ""much of this comes down to what you do to protect yourself."" So from masks to groceries, here's a reminder checklist of the measures epidemiologists and infectious disease experts say you should still absolutely be following, even if you live in a place that's re-opening:

Use masks carefully

Since early April the Centers for Disease Control has suggested that people wear masks or cloth face coverings outside of the home to help prevent the spread of Covid-19. In addition to having a face mask to use, ""people have to be very careful about how they put them on and how they take some off,"" Morse says. Wash your hands before putting your mask on your face. Fit is key: Your mask should cover your nose and mouth snugly, but comfortably. ""There's a wire that goes over the nose piece that you have to mold to your nose,"" Vinetz says. ""Then you have to tuck [the mask] under your chin."" ""It's not hard [to wear a mask], but somebody has to kind of show people how to do it right,"" he adds. (This helpful video demonstrates how to wear a mask.) Indeed, wearing a mask can feel somewhat uncomfortable, but both for effective prevention and sanitary reasons, it's important to keep it on during your entire outing, instead of removing it to take breaks or talk to people. When you take your mask off, you should remove it without touching the front of it, and wash your hands afterwards, Morse says. ""If [masks] become contaminated and you touch them ‚Äî even if your hands are clean ‚Äî when you then touch your face afterwards you can infect yourself,"" he says. Reusable cloth masks should be cleaned regularly, per the CDC, which means after each time you wear it, or whenever it becomes soiled. You can wash masks in a washing machine with hot water, and tumble dry them with high heat.

Steer clear of people on the street

Most of us have heard that we need to be at least six feet from other people when out in public. ""That's not a magic number,"" but it's believed to be the distance necessary to prevent respiratory droplets from reaching you if someone sneezes or coughs, Morse says. Physical distance can be hard to come by. ""There's a limit to how far you can, especially in New York City, keep apart,"" Morse says. Try to avoid looking at people face-to-face when you're outside in crowded places, Morse says. ""It sounds strange,"" but it keeps you out of people's line of breath, he adds. You can also try to stagger how you're walking so that you're side-by-side with others, rather than directly behind someone.

Keep washing your hands diligently

Hand hygiene is still incredibly important, because it's easy to accidentally touch your face and infect yourself. ""You always want to make sure your hands are clean,"" Morse says. Wash your hands with soap and water or use hand sanitizer at all the normal times, he says. For example, wash your hands after going to the bathroom; after touching garbage; and before, during and after food prep. ""Also after you touch something on the outside and you come back inside,"" he says. That includes touching doorknobs, opening packages or pressing elevator buttons. Wearing gloves may give you a false sense of security, Vinetz says. If you do wear gloves, you should assume that your hands are dirty, and avoid touching your face. ""If anybody is wearing gloves, I look at them and say, 'You're contaminated, don't touch anything,'"" he says.

Be strategic about running errands

When you're running essential errands or frequenting businesses as they begin to open, you should still be extra careful. For starters, you definitely shouldn't be venturing out if you're sick, according to the CDC. Take fewer trips to the store to reduce the amount of exposure you have to other people, and order your food and medication for delivery if possible (and don't accept deliveries in-person), per the CDC. Opt to pay for your items online or over the phone, and use a contactless payment method if you can. If you do go to the store, stay at least six feet from other people and wear a cloth face covering or mask, the CDC says. Some stores have delineated a ""safe distance"" on the floor in checkout lines, and wipes available for patrons to disinfect shopping carts. But even still, you should not touch your eyes, nose or mouth throughout the duration of your trip. Once you're finished shopping, use hand sanitizer and wash your hands with soap and water when you're home.

Handle packages and groceries gingerly

Many people are relying on deliveries to get their groceries and other supplies with minimal contact. But there's evidence that the Covid-19 virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days. When you get a package or bring home a shopping bag, Morse suggests opening it outside of your home. ""Leave it outside the door, and then with clean hands, I would lift out the things that were inside,"" he says. If the contents look like they need to be cleaned, you can wipe them with a disinfectant, he says, but it's not totally necessary. Put the items on a surface that you can clean easily afterwards, and of course wash your hands, Morse says. ""There's only so much you can do, you know, within reason,"" he says.

Follow elevator etiquette

Riding the elevator with someone is a comparatively short time to be exposed to their germs, but you should still be mindful. ""Minimize the number of people in an elevator,"" Morse says. Elevators are slightly less crowded while people are staying home, so you should wait until you can catch a ride alone or with as few people as possible, he says. And wear a face mask while in the elevator, even if you're riding solo. Pressing buttons with a key or other inanimate object can't hurt, but you still need to wash your hands when you come home, he adds.

Trump suspended U.S. contributions to the WHO last month, accusing it of promoting Chinese ‚Äúdisinformation‚Äù about the novel coronavirus outbreak, although WHO officials denied the accusation and China said it was transparent and open.

""If the WHO does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the WHO permanent and reconsider our membership,"" Trump told its chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a letter posted bit.ly/3bNB3R7 on Twitter.

Earlier, Trump said the Geneva-based WHO had ‚Äúdone a very sad job‚Äù in its handling of the coronavirus, which emerged in China late last year, and he would make a decision on funding soon.

Trump said in the letter the only way forward for the WHO was for it to demonstrate independence from China, adding that his administration had started discussing reform with Tedros.

Trump also made various accusations against China in the letter including that it tried to block evidence the virus could be transmitted between people, pressed the WHO not to declare it an emergency, refused to share data and samples and denied access to its scientists and facilities.

China hit back on Tuesday with its foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, saying the letter was slanderous.

‚ÄúThe U.S. leadership‚Äôs open letter is filled with phrases of suggestions, maybes, and potentialities, and is trying to mislead the public through this specious method, to achieve the goal of smearing and slandering China‚Äôs efforts in epidemic prevention and to shift responsibility in its own incompetence in handling the epidemic,‚Äù Zhao told a regular briefing.

Zhao said the U.S. decision to stop contributing to the WHO was a violation of its international obligations.

‚ÄòREVIEW AS SOON AS POSSIBLE‚Äô

A WHO spokeswoman in Geneva said on Tuesday the agency had no immediate comment on Trump‚Äôs letter but expected to have ‚Äúmore clarity‚Äù and a reaction to it later in the day.

On Monday, the WHO said an independent review of the global coronavirus response would begin as soon as possible and it had received backing and a hefty pledge of funds from China.

The WHO, a U.N. specialized agency, is leading a global initiative to develop safe and effective vaccines, tests and drugs to prevent, diagnose and treat COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.

More than 4.75 million people have been infected globally and 314,414 have died, according to a Reuters tally.

The United States contributed more than $400 million to the WHO in 2019, or about 15% of its budget.

This year, the United States has already paid the WHO about $58 million, senior Trump administration officials said last month, half of what it is required to pay for 2020 - known as an assessed contribution.

The House is expected to vote on the package as soon as Friday, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said there is no ‚Äúurgency.‚Äù The Senate will wait until after Memorial Day to act.

The so-called Heroes Act is built around nearly $1 trillion for states, cities and tribal governments to avert layoffs, focused chiefly on $375 billion for smaller suburban and rural municipalities largely left out of earlier rounds of aid.

It will offer a fresh round of $1,200 direct cash aid to individuals, increased to up to $6,000 per household, and launches a $175 billion housing assistance fund to help pay rents and mortgages. There is $75 billion more for virus testing.

It would continue, through January, the $600-per-week boost to unemployment benefits. It adds a 15% increase for food stamps and new help for paying employer-backed health coverage. For businesses, there‚Äôs an employee retention tax credit.

There‚Äôs $200 billion in ‚Äúhazard pay‚Äù for essential workers on the front lines of the crisis.

Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said the bill ‚Äúwill be ready‚Äù to call lawmakers back to Washington for the vote.

But the 1,800-page package is heading straight into a Senate roadblock. Senate Republicans are not planning to vote on any new relief until June, after a Memorial Day recess.

President Donald Trump has already signed into law nearly $3 trillion in aid approved by Congress.

The new package extends some provisions from previous aid packages, and adds new ones.

There are other new resources, including $25 billion for the U.S. Postal Service. There is help for the 2020 Census and the November election. The bill also provides $3.6 billion to help local officials prepare for the challenges of holding elections during the pandemic.

The popular Payroll Protection Program, which has been boosted in past bills, would see another $10 billion to ensure under-served businesses and nonprofit organizations have access to grants through a disaster loan program.

For hospitals and other health care providers, there‚Äôs another $100 billion infusion to help cover costs and additional help for hospitals serving low-income communities.

There‚Äôs another $600 million in funding to tackle the issue of rapid spread of the virus in state and federal prisons, along with $600 million in help to local police departments for salaries and equipment

As states weigh the health risks of re-opening, McConnell said the nation needs to ‚Äúregroup and find a more sustainable middle ground between total lockdown and total normalcy.‚Äù

The Republican leader on Tuesday called the emerging Democratic bill a ‚Äúbig laundry list of pet priorities.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo those who would suggest a pause, I would say the hunger doesn‚Äôt take a pause, the rent doesn‚Äôt take a pause,‚Äù Pelosi said late Monday on MSNBC. ‚ÄúWe have a big need. It‚Äôs monumental.‚Äù

But Senate Republicans are in no rush to spend what could be trillions more on aid.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we have yet felt the urgency of acting immediately,‚Äù McConnell told reporters Monday at the Capitol.

McConnell said he has been in close contact with the White House, assessing the aid Congress has already approved in response to the virus outbreak and next steps.

Trump is expected to meet Tuesday with a group of Senate Republicans. ‚ÄúIf we decide to go forward, we‚Äôll go forward together,‚Äù McConnell said. His priority is to ensure any new package includes liability protections for health care providers and businesses that are reopening.

Senate Republicans are not expected to act on any further aid until after the Memorial Day recess, according to a senior Republican aide unauthorized to discuss the planning and granted anonymity.

The Senate is set to recess at the end of next week for a previously scheduled break, with senators scheduled to return June 1.

The Senate recently reopened its side of the Capitol while the House remains largely shuttered due the the health concerns.

Senators have been in session since last week, voting on Trump‚Äôs nominees for judicial and executive branch positions and other issues. The Senate majority, the 53-member Senate Republican conference, is meeting for its regular luncheons most days, spread out three to a table for social distance. Democrats are convening by phone. Many senators, but not all, are wearing masks.

At least a dozen Capitol police officers and other staff have tested positive for the virus, and at least one senator, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, is in isolation at home after exposure from a staff member who tested positive. Other lawmakers have cycled in and out of quarantine.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer warned that if Trump and congressional Republicans ‚Äúslow walk‚Äù more aid they will be repeating President Herbert Hoover‚Äôs ‚Äútepid‚Äù response to the Great Depression.

There‚Äôs $200 billion in ‚Äúhazard pay‚Äù for essential workers on the front lines of the crisis.  Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said the bill ‚Äúwill be ready‚Äù to call lawmakers back to Washington for the vote.  But the 1,800-page package is heading straight into a Senate roadblock. Senate Republicans are not planning to vote on any new relief until June, after a Memorial Day recess.  President Donald Trump has already signed into law nearly $3 trillion in aid approved by Congress.  The new package extends some provisions from previous aid packages, and adds new ones.  There are other new resources, including $25 billion for the U.S. Postal Service. There is help for the 2020 Census and the November election. The bill also provides $3.6 billion to help local officials prepare for the challenges of holding elections during the pandemic.  The popular Payroll Protection Program, which has been boosted in past bills, would see another $10 billion to ensure under-served businesses and nonprofit organizations have access to grants through a disaster loan program.  For hospitals and other health care providers, there‚Äôs another $100 billion infusion to help cover costs and additional help for hospitals serving low-income communities.  There‚Äôs another $600 million in funding to tackle the issue of rapid spread of the virus in state and federal prisons, along with $600 million in help to local police departments for salaries and equipment  As states weigh the health risks of re-opening, McConnell said the nation needs to ‚Äúregroup and find a more sustainable middle ground between total lockdown and total normalcy.‚Äù  The Republican leader on Tuesday called the emerging Democratic bill a ‚Äúbig laundry list of pet priorities.‚Äù  ‚ÄúTo those who would suggest a pause, I would say the hunger doesn‚Äôt take a pause, the rent doesn‚Äôt take a pause,‚Äù Pelosi said late Monday on MSNBC. ‚ÄúWe have a big need. It‚Äôs monumental.‚Äù  But Senate Republicans are in no rush to spend what could be trillions more on aid.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we have yet felt the urgency of acting immediately,‚Äù McConnell told reporters Monday at the Capitol.  McConnell said he has been in close contact with the White House, assessing the aid Congress has already approved in response to the virus outbreak and next steps.  Trump is expected to meet Tuesday with a group of Senate Republicans. ‚ÄúIf we decide to go forward, we‚Äôll go forward together,‚Äù McConnell said. His priority is to ensure any new package includes liability protections for health care providers and businesses that are reopening.  Senate Republicans are not expected to act on any further aid until after the Memorial Day recess, according to a senior Republican aide unauthorized to discuss the planning and granted anonymity.  The Senate is set to recess at the end of next week for a previously scheduled break, with senators scheduled to return June 1.  The Senate recently reopened its side of the Capitol while the House remains largely shuttered due the the health concerns.  Senators have been in session since last week, voting on Trump‚Äôs nominees for judicial and executive branch positions and other issues. The Senate majority, the 53-member Senate Republican conference, is meeting for its regular luncheons most days, spread out three to a table for social distance. Democrats are convening by phone. Many senators, but not all, are wearing masks.  At least a dozen Capitol police officers and other staff have tested positive for the virus, and at least one senator, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, is in isolation at home after exposure from a staff member who tested positive. Other lawmakers have cycled in and out of quarantine.  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer warned that if Trump and congressional Republicans ‚Äúslow walk‚Äù more aid they will be repeating President Herbert Hoover‚Äôs ‚Äútepid‚Äù response to the Great Depression.

And that could mean 50 to 150 Illinoisans losing their lives to the coronavirus a day ‚Äì or possibly as many as 300 each day.

Those were some of the grim estimates Gov. J.B. Pritzker delivered from his own home on Monday, a mix of troubling projections coupled with a few optimistic signs of progress for parts of the state outside the Chicago area.

The daily death toll Monday was 54, at the low end of the projections for the peak period. But that follows an especially deadly week, and it was announced amid a new round of scientific modeling.

And those dire projections come at an extremely inopportune time for the Democratic governor, who is facing criticism from Republican legislators, unemployed workers who appear stuck in limbo and President Donald Trump.

It also comes as many in Illinois are suffering from cabin fever, growing increasingly restless over their lives having been disrupted for more than eight weeks.

For the first time Monday, Pritzker delivered his daily briefing from his home office ‚Äî a drawing of his late mother behind him ‚Äî as he broadcast live after a senior staffer tested positive for coronavirus. The governor said he himself has tested negative twice for coronavirus.

The governor also offered some good news along with his bad news projections. After announcing his reopening plan last week that divides the state into four regions and evaluates phases of re-openings based on health metrics, Pritzker said all regions except for the Northeast region ‚Äúare on pace‚Äù to be able to move to the next phase come May 29, the last day of the stay-at-home executive order.

The next phase, Phase 3, allows a number of businesses to reopen, with the use of ‚Äúface coverings as the norm,‚Äù including non-essential manufacturing and some non-essential businesses, including barber shops and salons.

But in the Northeast region, home to Chicago and Cook County, the positivity rate ‚Äî the number of positive cases compared to tests taken ‚Äî remains too high. Still, the governor signaled there‚Äôs still time to get that number lower. His plan in part entails 14 days of a positivity rate under 20%.

In total, 3,459 people have died of coronavirus in Illinois ‚Äî 803 of them last week. As of Monday, the state also reported 1,266 new cases, bringing the total of positive cases to 79,007. The state received 12,441 tests results.

In late April, Pritzker‚Äôs office released a COVID-19 projection and worst-case fatality scenario based on scientific modeling that predicted a range of 50 to 150 deaths per day into early May. That projection was created by researchers from the Illinois Department of Public Health, as well as researchers from Northwestern University, the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

The latest projection shows Illinois is indeed in a peak period for coronavirus deaths, but it‚Äôs less like a peak and more like a plateau.

The death range remains between 50 and 150 a day in models from both the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Northwestern University, however, is projecting a range of 50 to 300 daily deaths. The University of Chicago predicts the state seeing a death plateau until July, while both Northwestern and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are predicting it could last until June.

Beginning on April 23, the state saw 11 days in that originally predicted death range. On May 4, 46 deaths were reported. On May 5, the state saw its worst day with 176 fatalities. And since May 6, the state has consistently seen between 50 and 150 deaths a day, which is what the modelers predicted.

‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt passed our peak yet. We have seen more stability in our numbers, but so far, we are not seeing significant declines in key metrics like hospitalization,‚Äù Pritzker said. ‚ÄúThe updates to our models reflect that data.‚Äù

Pritzker said the time frame of ‚Äúplateauing near a peak‚Äù into mid-May ‚Äúhas been expanded from mid-May into mid-June.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn many ways, this news is disheartening,‚Äù Pritzker said. ‚ÄúWe have made great progress, but it‚Äôs forced us to remain at a moderated though still high level of key metrics for this extended period. A pushing out of our estimated peak is a natural consequence of flattening the curve. Remember that no one can truly stop this virus without a vaccine. But what we‚Äôve been aiming to do since early March is slow down the exponential rate of transmission.‚Äù

The slowing down, he said, has helped health care workers to treat those with coronavirus and give pharmaceutical researchers time to develop effective treatments and ultimately a vaccine.

‚ÄúPushing the peak down and therefore to a longer time frame might not sound like good news to some, but I promise you it is saving lives,‚Äù Pritzker said.

The number of COVID-19 patients entering ICU beds went up by 16, from Saturday to Sunday night, according to Pritzker‚Äôs office. The number of ventilators being used by coronavirus patients also increased by 21, and the total number of COVID-19 patients increased by 26 patients.

The positivity rate statewide as of Monday is 10.17%. In the Northeast region, which includes Cook County and Chicago, the positivity rate is about 22%.

Meanwhile, Pritzker‚Äôs administration said the state has not yet received a shipment of swabs and viral transport media from the federal government. That shipment was anticipated in early May but has not yet arrived.

China wants to beat the world in the race to find a coronavirus vaccine ‚Äî and, by some measures, it is doing just that.
Desperate to protect its people and to deflect growing international criticism of how it handled the outbreak, it has slashed red tape and offered resources to drug companies. Four Chinese companies have started testing their vaccine candidates on humans, more than the United States and Britain combined.
But China‚Äôs leaders have empowered a vaccine industry that has long been mired in quality problems and scandals. Just two years ago, Chinese parents erupted in fury after they discovered ineffective vaccines had been given mostly to babies.
Finding a vaccine isn‚Äôt enough. China‚Äôs companies must also win over the trust of the public, who might be more inclined to choose a foreign-made vaccine over a Chinese one.
‚ÄúThe Chinese now do not have confidence in the vaccines produced in China,‚Äù said Ray Yip, the former head of the Gates Foundation in China. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs probably going to be the biggest headache. If they didn‚Äôt have all those incidents, people will probably line up by the miles to get it.‚Äù
The need is urgent. More than 247,000 people have died globally, by official figures as of Monday, and the true count is probably much higher. The coronavirus remains stubbornly difficult to stamp out ‚Äî even China, which officially appears to have tamed the spread, has suffered from sporadic outbreaks.
China also wants to deflect accusations that its silencing of early warnings contributed to the global pandemic. Developing a vaccine for the world would, in addition, burnish its standing as a global scientific and medical power.
So China has made its vaccine a national priority, though it hasn‚Äôt disclosed spending details. One senior official said a vaccine for emergency use could be ready by September. State media has made a celebrity out of Chen Wei, the Chinese military‚Äôs top virologist, who is leading one of the vaccine efforts. The public is responding.
Huang Shiyue, an 18-year-old first-year medical student in Wuhan, left her apartment on a recent early Sunday morning for the first time in three months to take a taxi to a wellness center an hour away. There, she offered up her arm in the name of science.
But in an illustration of how difficult it will be to find a safe and effective treatment, Ms. Huang grew dizzy and sick.
‚ÄúIf I can help and benefit people with one little move,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúthen I think this is a very worthwhile thing.‚Äù
China‚Äôs vaccine drive has put Beijing‚Äôs considerable strengths and glaring weaknesses on display. With its firm hand on the levers of Chinese industry, Beijing can corral companies and scientists to reach national goals.
At the same time, China‚Äôs vaccine companies have been accustomed to a closed political system that has a history of covering up safety scandals and protects them from foreign competition. Few invest heavily in research and development, and they have not discovered many products with global impact.
Instead, many invest more in selling and distribution, a large chunk of which includes managing relationships with local disease control centers. Experts say that creates incentives for corruption.
China‚Äôs regulators also tend to look the other way when it comes to state-owned firms, which make up about 40 percent of the vaccine industry. Many vaccine makers operate with an expectation of impunity, knowing that even if they are found to have produced faulty products, they are unlikely to be shut down.
The vaccine that Ms. Huang received is being developed by CanSino Biologics, a Tianjin-based pharmaceutical firm, and the medical science arm of the People‚Äôs Liberation Army. The CanSino vaccine was the first to enter Phase 2 trials, which in the hierarchy of drug testing means it is further along than the world‚Äôs other candidates, though there is no guarantee that it will be proven effective. (It has been tested so far on 508 people; a candidate from Oxford University in Phase 1 trials, or earlier-stage testing, has been administered to twice as many people.)
One other Chinese institution also has a candidate in Phase 2 testing ‚Äî the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, an arm of state-run Sinopharm Group. Sinovac Biotech, a private company and the Beijing Institute of Biological Products, which also belongs to Sinopharm, have potential vaccines in Phase 1 trials.
The Wuhan institute was involved in a 2018 scandal in which defective vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough and other conditions were injected into hundreds of thousands of babies. China imposed a $1.3 billion fine on another virus maker involved, Changchun Changsheng. The scandal led to the firing of dozens of officials and pledges of a swift industry cleanup.
The government confiscated the Wuhan institute‚Äôs ‚Äúillegal income,‚Äù fined the company and punished nine executives.
The Wuhan institute has been sued at least twice in China by plaintiffs who have alleged that the institute‚Äôs vaccines have caused ‚Äúabnormal reactions,‚Äù according to court documents. In both cases, the court ruled that the Wuhan institute had to partially compensate the victims a total of roughly $71,500. Its executives have been accused at least three times of bribing officials at local centers for disease and control in various provinces to thank them for purchasing their vaccines. The executives were convicted but no criminal charges were pursued against the company.
Sinovac Biotech had also been involved in a bribery scandal, according to court documents. From 2002 to 2014, a court in Beijing said, the general manager of Sinovac Biotech gave China‚Äôs deputy director in charge of drug evaluations nearly $50,000 to help the firm with drug approvals. Sinovac was not charged. The general manager was a man surnamed Yin, the documents showed. Chinese media reports have said that person is the current chief executive, Yin Weidong, who held the title of general manager from 2001 to 2017.
Sinovac, the Wuhan institute, and its parent, China National Biotec Group, did not respond to requests for comment.
Despite the companies‚Äô earlier stumbles, the Chinese government has given them permission to accelerate trials. Regulators in the United States and other places have done the same for other companies. The Wuhan institute, Sinovac and the Beijing institute got combined approvals to run the first two phases, a decision questioned by several Chinese scientists, who felt that safety results from the first phase should be evaluated before the second phase was begun.
Ding Sheng, the dean of the pharmacy school at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said that some companies were ‚Äúadopting unconventional methods‚Äù in the preclinical research stage, running tasks like the design process and animal modeling at the same time when they should be done consecutively, according to the People‚Äôs Daily, the Communist Party‚Äôs official newspaper.
‚ÄúI understand the people‚Äôs eager anticipation of a vaccine,‚Äù Dr. Ding was quoted as saying. ‚ÄúBut from a scientific point of view, no matter how anxious we are, we cannot lower our standards.‚Äù He did not respond to a request for comment.
Dr. Chen‚Äôs academy issued calls on the internet for phase one volunteers. Ms. Huang successfully registered for the second round on April 10. The next day, she got a call and text message: Please come tomorrow.
‚ÄúOf course, I was worried at the beginning,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúTo say you‚Äôre not at all worried is impossible, right?‚Äù She surfed the internet and called her teacher, who listed pros and cons. She sought advice from her parents.
Then she went. Workers ran an antibody test, to make sure she was not already immune to the coronavirus, an H.I.V. test and a pregnancy test.
The participants were divided into low- and medium-dose groups and another placebo group, as part of a ‚Äúdouble-blind‚Äù experiment. They were not told their group.
Fifteen minutes after Ms. Huang got her shot, she started to feel dizzy. Her stomach hurt. Her heart began beating fast. She got diarrhea.
Dr. Chen and other doctors checked her. Someone offered her hot water. She took a walk in the sun. Finally, they took her in an ambulance to a subway station, where she took a taxi home.
Ms. Huang said she feels fine at home.Shi Zibo, a junior in college, also signed up to be a volunteer and got the shot on April 12. On the fourth day, he got a slight fever but said he has no other side effects.
‚ÄúI felt very proud when I received the call,‚Äù Mr. Shi said. ‚ÄúThere are not many opportunities for me in to contribute to other people in this life, so I will not regret it, regardless of the final result.‚ÄùAmber Wang and Liu Yi contributed research in Beijing.",Left,USA,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,China‚Äôs Coronavirus Vaccine Drive Empowers a Troubled Industry,"China wants to beat the world in the race to find a coronavirus vaccine ‚Äî and, by some measures, it is doing just that.

Chinese media reports have said that person is the current chief executive, Yin Weidong, who held the title of general manager from 2001 to 2017. Sinovac, the Wuhan institute, and its parent, China National Biotec Group, did not respond to requests for comment. Despite the companies‚Äô earlier stumbles, the Chinese government has given them permission to accelerate trials. Regulators in the United States and other places have done the same for other companies. The Wuhan institute, Sinovac and the Beijing institute got combined approvals to run the first two phases, a decision questioned by several Chinese scientists, who felt that safety results from the first phase should be evaluated before the second phase was begun. Ding Sheng, the dean of the pharmacy school at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said that some companies were ‚Äúadopting unconventional methods‚Äù in the preclinical research stage, running tasks like the design process and animal modeling at the same time when they should be done consecutively, according to the People‚Äôs Daily, the Communist Party‚Äôs official newspaper. ‚ÄúI understand the people‚Äôs eager anticipation of a vaccine,‚Äù Dr. Ding was quoted as saying. ‚ÄúBut from a scientific point of view, no matter how anxious we are, we cannot lower our standards.‚Äù He did not respond to a request for comment. Dr. Chen‚Äôs academy issued calls on the internet for phase one volunteers. Ms. Huang successfully registered for the second round on April 10. The next day, she got a call and text message: Please come tomorrow. ‚ÄúOf course, I was worried at the beginning,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúTo say you‚Äôre not at all worried is impossible, right?‚Äù She surfed the internet and called her teacher, who listed pros and cons. She sought advice from her parents. Then she went. Workers ran an antibody test, to make sure she was not already immune to the coronavirus, an H.I.V. test and a pregnancy test. The participants were divided into low- and medium-dose groups and another placebo group, as part of a ‚Äúdouble-blind‚Äù experiment. They were not told their group. Fifteen minutes after Ms. Huang got her shot, she started to feel dizzy. Her stomach hurt. Her heart began beating fast. She got diarrhea. Dr. Chen and other doctors checked her. Someone offered her hot water. She took a walk in the sun. Finally, they took her in an ambulance to a subway station, where she took a taxi home. Ms. Huang said she feels fine at home.Shi Zibo, a junior in college, also signed up to be a volunteer and got the shot on April 12. On the fourth day, he got a slight fever but said he has no other side effects. ‚ÄúI felt very proud when I received the call,‚Äù Mr. Shi said. ‚ÄúThere are not many opportunities for me in to contribute to other people in this life, so I will not regret it, regardless of the final result.‚ÄùAmber Wang and Liu Yi contributed research in Beijing."

The US embassy hasn't been helpful.,https://i.insider.com/5ebed09d2618b9798e476a26?width=1200&format=jpeg,"Klement and Linda Camaj temporarily moved to Kuwait in early March.

In early May, the country announced a 24-hour coronavirus curfew, only allowing residents with identification out to grocery shop by appointment.

The cheapest flights the couple found out of the country were $5,000 each, which was not possible for them.

The US embassy told them it couldn't help at this time.

When Kuwait announced earlier this month that it was implementing a 24-hour lockdown to stem the spread of the coronavirus, residents flocked to grocery stores by the thousands.

People stood in lines ‚Äî some blocks long ‚Äî in heat that exceeded 90 degrees, according to Klement and Linda Camaj, two Americans in Kuwait for work.

Because the announcement fell during Ramadan, when Muslims traditionally fast from sunrise to sunset, some people waiting in the heat fainted, Linda Camaj told Business Insider.

""It was by far the most surreal thing I've ever experienced,"" said Linda, who said she waited in line on May 9 for six hours with her husband.

""I honestly thought the line was for something else,"" Klement said in the phone interview. ""We saw a handful of people pass out, completely passed out ... You have to take into consideration that they are fasting and they can't drink water. They can't eat.""

The Camajs, who both work at the Berlin-based think tank A Path for Europe, traveled to Kuwait City in early March. While news of the coronavirus had already been spreading, the couple thought that Kuwait may be spared from the kind of outbreaks other countries were experiencing.

As the situation got worse and the 24-hour curfew was announced the second week of May, the couple tried to stock up on groceries.

Despite waiting in lines for hours for two days before the lockdown went into effect, the stores closed before they made it inside.

People waited in lines for hours to get groceries ahead of Kuwait's total lockdown. Linda Camaj

Kuwait now allows residents to go grocery shopping by appointment. But because the Camajs are on tourist visas, they can only order delivery. Realizing that delivery would be nearly impossible with such high demand, they attempted to book a flight home, but the cheapest tickets they could find were for $5,000 each, they said.

Unable to pay that, and feeling out of options, they reached out to the US embassy in Kuwait by phone and email, hoping that they could provide the couple with documentation so they could leave the house to get food and drinking water.

The embassy representative asked them whether they had running water and internet, which they do, and then told them that they can either stick it out and wait for more delivery times to be added or pay for the flights home, according to an email viewed by Business Insider. Several phone calls went the same way, they told Business Insider.

The couple was shocked by the government's response.

""Am I going to fry the WiFi router and eat it?"" Klement told Business Insider.

""We would love to be able to go back to New York, we would love to,"" Linda said. ""But we don't have $10,000.""

The couple survived on chips and marshmallows for a day before a friend stepped up to help

After arriving home from two grocery stores on May 9 and 10, sweaty and empty-handed, the couple found snacks around the home to eat.

The 20-day total lockdown is planned to last through May 30, according to Reuters.

""On Monday, we shared a bottle of water, and marshmallows, and chips,"" Klement told Business Insider.

On Tuesday, a friend who lives nearby was able to get an appointment to go shopping and picked up a few items for the couple.

They didn't want to ask their friend to help because people are limited to shop for 30 items each week, so anything their friend bought on their behalf would be one less item for his family, Klement said.

The couple is keeping a tally of the days they have been confined to their apartment. Linda Camaj

The Camajs said that they realize that there are people in the world, including the United States and Kuwait, that are in far worse situations than they are during this pandemic.

While they are uncomfortable, they have been able to make it work, they said.

More than anything, the couple is frustrated with the lack of response from the US Department of State.

Klement said that when a friend from Britain, who is also in Kuwait, found herself in a similar situation her embassy sent groceries to the door.

He wasn't expecting that kind of help from the US State Department, but was hoping that he could be provided with a document that allowed them to leave the apartment to buy food.

The US Department of State didn't immediately return a Business Insider message seeking comment.

""I'm not asking for charity, just give me some sort of paper that lets me buy some food,"" Klement told Business Insider. ""I truly believe the role of my government is safeguarding its citizens.""

Linda and Klement Camaj are continuing to look for flights home

As the total lockdown continues, the couple is continuing to try to order groceries online.

The Kuwaiti government allows people to leave the house to walk between 4:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m., but the streets have been crowded. Many people have been out without masks, which is in violation of the lockdown, Linda said, leaving the couple feeling too unsafe to leave their homes.

Last week Kuwait's Ministry of Health reported that it had registered its first three-digit jump in cases over 24 hours. On Thursday, an additional 947 positive coronavirus cases had been detected over a one day period, bringing the total in the country to 11,975, Al-Monitor reported.

Prior to the lockdown, the cases were in the 7,000 range, Klement said.

The couple feels that the rush to grocery stores over May 9 and 10 are responsible for the uptick.

The couple is beginning to give up trying to go straight home. Instead, they're looking at flights to Sweden or the Netherlands, where they have family. From there, they will look for flights to the US.

The couple said that after unsuccessful talks with the US embassy, they reached out to the Swedish and Dutch embassy. Neither one of them are citizens there, but found the people the reached on the phone to be more helpful to them in terms of offering advice.

""On the other hand, you have the world's greatest superpower that says 'sorry sir there's nothing I can do for you,'"" Klement said, referring to the US. ""I felt like I was calling Verizon.""",Left-center,USA,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,An American couple is stuck in Kuwait under 24-hour curfew and isn't allowed to grocery shop.

Bush‚Äôs second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. ‚ÄúAllowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,‚Äù argued one Republican close to the president.

‚ÄúThe closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.‚Äù Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, ‚ÄúIf things don‚Äôt look like they‚Äôre bouncing back by September, I think that‚Äôs going to be a problem.‚Äù

The fear that Trump can‚Äôt survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump‚Äôs statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the ‚Äúeconomic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.‚Äù

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump‚Äôs measures of success. But after a manic 3¬Ω years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.  By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to play that game,‚Äù said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. ‚ÄúI think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they‚Äôre not uniform across states and across countries.‚Äù  But even beyond the death count, there‚Äôs a widespread reluctance to define what success means. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,‚Äù the official said.

Businesses that are based around gathering people together for a tour, a game, travel or a conference are finding new ways to get money coming in the door.

Milwaukee Food & City Tours can't load up buses of strangers to take them on a tour of Milwaukee these days. Stay-at-home orders and social distancing requirements make it nearly impossible. Even with the easing of restrictions, it's unknown when the general public will feel comfortable gathering again.

The company started receiving phone calls for cancellations as soon as President Donald Trump declared a national emergency. By the next day, more than $200,000 in business was canceled or refunded, said company owner Theresa Nemetz.

""Within 48 hours, I realized we were completely out of business unless we pivot,"" Nemetz said.

Can these stores survive?:Can these 13 retailers outlast coronavirus?

Lost Penney? J.C. Penney says it plans to close nearly 29% of stores ‚Äì or 242 locations ‚Äì as part of its bankruptcy

Coming up with a new line of business was the only way Nemetz could keep paying her five-person full-time staff and continue to call part-time workers.

The idea was to bring the sights and tastes of Milwaukee to customers' doors with care packages. Instead of taking people through the city for sausages at Usinger's and pretzels from Milwaukee Pretzel Co., Milwaukee Food & City Tours is packing those items up (along with virtual tour experience access) and shipping it out.

Milwaukee Food & City Tours started in late March with quarantine care kits and shelter-in-style kits.

Nearly 2,000 care packages have been sold. The move is sustaining Nemetz's business. She has not had to furlough staff members. She also received federals funds through the Paycheck Protection Program.

The selection has expanded with specialty care packages for events like birthdays, Mother's Day and Cinco De Mayo. The kits vary in price from around $35 for a chocolate self-care kit to $78 for the ultimate snack break.

Milwaukee Food & City Tours is thinking about offering tours again to private groups with guides leaving adequate distance and talking through headsets. But it's also thinking about how these care packages can become a lasting part of the business.

""For the next couple of years, it's possible that some individuals won't be able to do a tour,"" she said. Instead of having travelers visit Milwaukee to learn about the city, she'll ship the experience to them.

Marla Poytinger isn't sure when her company will be able to bring 1,500 people through her bars for ax throwing, mini-golf, shuffleboard and painting again on a Saturday night.

The live, host-led trivia game her company launched during the pandemic will remain part of Bars & Recreation Inc.'s business line after bars open.

""Even if the world goes back to normal, which I don‚Äôt think anyone expects, there is still a huge market of people who ... still need to gather and interact but can‚Äôt or aren't willing to come together physically,"" Poytinger said. Public games are $9 per registration, which can include all the people quarantined together.

The company, which runs Axe MKE, Splash Studio, NorthSouth Club and Nine Below, is seeing maybe just 1% of its normal revenue, she said.

Many businesses like hers would lose all their revenue unless a new product could be sold.

Daniel Cruz was launching his new laundry service for Airbnb hosts, Washbnb, as the pandemic halted travel. The company faced a total loss. Cruz thought about shutting down, but laundry still needs to get done, even during a pandemic.

The company is also offering a pay-what-you-can model. It is operating at a loss and actively looking for investors to raise $450,000.

Nearly all the trade shows that BoothCentral Inc. works with to manage vendors are canceled for the foreseeable future.

It held its first virtual event in the middle of April.

On its new platform, BoothCentral is hosting art fairs, home and garden shows, and career fairs. The company is now growing and hiring to add to its staff of 10 employees. Even once in-person events are held again, BoothCentral anticipates hybrid models with online components.

The department store chain posted a 41 percent drop revenue for the quarter, offering a stark reminder of how the pandemic is boosting some retailers while hastening the demise of others.



Consumer spending has dropped precipitously in the weeks since the pandemic took hold. U.S. retail sales fell a record 8.3 percent in March, then plunged 16.4 percent in April, according to Commerce Department data, as Americans stopped spending on clothing, furniture, housewares and other nonessentials.



Retailers temporarily closed more than 260,000 stores because of the coronavirus outbreak, all but bringing business to a halt for many companies that rely on in-store shoppers to drive the bulk of their sales. Four major retailers ‚Äî J. Crew, Neiman Marcus, Stage Stores and J.C. Penney ‚Äî have filed for bankruptcy this month, and analysts say they expect others to follow as more companies run out of cash and the economy continues to sour.

Pier 1, which had filed for bankruptcy weeks before the shutdowns, announced Tuesday it would cease operations altogether. It had planned to closed 450 of its 936 stores and shed 40 percent of its workforce and find a buyer, but the pandemic ended those hopes.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a self-fulfilling prophecy: the bigger, stronger players are taking even more market share,‚Äù said Mickey Chadha, senior credit officer at the rating agency Moody‚Äôs. ‚ÄúAnd the companies that were weak to begin with, they are only going to become weaker.‚Äù



But spending on groceries has continued to climb. Walmart, the country‚Äôs largest grocer, said profits rose 4 percent, to $3.99 billion, during the first quarter. Demand has been so brisk that Walmart has hired more than 235,000 workers since mid-March, according to chief executive Doug McMillon. All 5,355 of the company‚Äôs U.S. stores have remained open during the pandemic.

But worker advocacy groups say the company‚Äôs gains have come at the risk of employees‚Äô health. At least 22 Walmart employees have died from covid-related complications since March, according to labor advocacy group United for Respect.

Walmart said it is providing free masks and gloves to employees and has installed sneeze guards at its checkouts. It has also announced two rounds of bonuses ‚Äî $150 for part-time workers, $300 for full-timers ‚Äî who work through the pandemic. It said it spent nearly $900 million on employee bonuses and other covid-related costs.

Home Depot, meanwhile, said sales at U.S. stores open at least one year rose nearly 8 percent. Profits fell nearly 12 percent to $2.25 billion, as the company spent more on wages and cleaning stores.

‚ÄúAlthough the pandemic has shrouded the retail world in gloom, Home Depot‚Äôs results are something of a bright spot,‚Äù Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.



That was not the case at Kohl‚Äôs, which was one of thousands of retailers that shut its stores and furloughed the majority of its workers in March. The department store chain posted $541 million quarterly loss, compared with a $62 million profit in the same period last year.

Nightlife looks completely different these days.

Bar patrons have taken things into their own hands -- shaking up cocktails at home, ordering booze from an app, turning up Bluetooth speakers to listen to a virtual DJ on Instagram live, maybe even while Zooming with friends.

But can that ever fully replace elbowing up to a crowded bar, chatting up a bartender and everything else that comes with a night out?

In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, with new social distancing requirements and ever-changing, state-by-state safety restrictions, many owners of bars and clubs are waiting with bated breath.

The coveted counter space and tables at Dante -- a famously packed, award-winning cocktail bar and restaurant in New York City -- quickly shifted to slinging specialty drinks via curbside pickup and delivery until restrictions are eased. But the staffers are taking service amid the pandemic ""one day at a time"" until they construct a plan to fully reopen.

""To be honest, none of us have any idea as to when things will really start to change,"" Linden Pride, owner of the Greenwich Village staple, told ABC News. ""This whole process has pushed us to create a full takeout and delivery menu, as well as cocktails to-go, which has taken us out of our comfort zone to create new, alternative experiences for our guests.""

Pride said he wants to continue the new experiences ""once this is all over."" He and his wife, Natalie, got the idea from a pop-up cocktail event in New Orleans, where people ""drink in a plastic cup and walk down the street."" They found thousands of stickers left over that read, ""'One for the road,' or 'a roadie' as we call it in Australia,"" Pride added.

He hailed New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for quickly recognizing current liquor-licensing regulations that needed to be amended.

""As soon as the changes were brought into effect, which allowed cocktails to be purchased both for pick-up and delivery, with food, we saw this as an opportunity to try and keep the business operational, which would allow us to retain staff whilst continuing to provide a service to the community,"" Pride told ABC News.

Pride said, ""it's so hard to know"" definitively what service operations at Dante might look like in the future, but that he and his staff are keeping a close eye on operations in other states, including Georgia and Colorado.

""When we're allowed to open, we will adhere to CDC, WHO and state guidelines,"" Pride said, adding that he's already stocked up on thermometers to check people's temperatures at the door and that he's looking into creating disposable menus and setting up sanitizing stations, in addition to enforcing social distancing.

""One cool initiative"" he's seen at bars and restaurants in parts of Europe, ""is the extension of outdoor dining -- with some street closures."" Pride said he sees a ""real opportunity in New York"" for designated outdoor dining and drinking areas to enable places on low-traffic streets to set up ""socially distanced tables"" and serve people responsibly.

Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday that the possibility of restaurants and bars opening in the city's streets is ""being very thoroughly discussed"" and ""something we might be able to reach.""

""I've been talking to restaurant owners ... they're making a great case that this could be a difference-maker,"" de Blasio said. ""You have the right social distancing and protections, the right capacity ... and the right atmosphere. We have to be smart about it."" This could only come after New York City meets the city's indicators for 10 to 14 days and meets the state's indicators, which de Blasio said could be possible in the first half of June.

Pride said that with ""any kind of reopening, it doesn't mean that customers are going to flock to [bars] and fill up those seats."" Dante will look for other inventive options to recreate what Pride calls the ""ritual and experience"" of going out, like ""creating a Friday night takeaway kit"" complete with cocktails and a playlist to give customers the full experience at home.

Pride has also been in contact with close friends in the industry, including the operator of New York's PDT, and said bars and lounges that rely solely on beverages and bottle service will face ""a huge challenge because they don't have full-service kitchens.""

A standard liquor license requires nightclubs and bars to serve food in order to run a full-service beer, wine and liquor operation, according to the New York State Liquor Authority.

Eddie Dean, owner of the Brooklyn club Schimanski, has been through many ups and downs after 30 years in the nightlife business, but he's worried now about bars and clubs.

""These businesses are built on volume. A very large percentage of small bars and restaurants pretty much go week to week hoping to make payroll,"" he told ABC News. ""I imagine a high percentage of New York City-based hospitality businesses will not reopen -- or open but not be able to sustain. It's going to be ugly.""

Schimanski ""acted fast to close down"" -- perishable items cleaned out, sound equipment covered, employees furloughed. Dean now is having ""preliminary conversations"" with the landlord to ""get through this mess as best as possible.""

""So far,"" he added, ""I have not heard anything positive for clubs. Any notion of opening at 25 or 50% capacity or even 75% isn't realistic. We will do what it takes to ensure the safety of our staff and all our guests.""

Even amid the current difficulties, Dean said there have been silver linings, like staying in touch with his team and ""thinking of new ideas and concepts."" And being able to rest a bit ""has been welcome.""

""Anyone who knows me knows I love a good challenge. This is certainly a big challenge. I can't wait to get back and do great things,"" he added.

Slate, a multi-floor lounge and nightclub with multiple bars and hundreds of hands-on games like pool and ping pong, has catered to Manhattan's lively late-night crowds for over 20 years. But it could struggle welcoming back customers at a 6-foot distance.

Owner Aristotle ""Telly"" Hatzigeorgiou told ABC News, ""We're adjusting as best we can.""

The owner's plan for a return to operations will eventually include ""strict sanitation guidelines that will be followed between each use, and we'll make sure all tables, chairs and games are spread apart enough that people can safely socially distance themselves.""

He added: ""Temperatures will be taken at the door. Hand sanitation stations will be placed all over the venue, and markers will be placed both inside and on the sidewalk outside for any line that may form to ensure guests stay 6 feet apart while we check IDs, take temperatures and check coats.""

Hatzigeorgiou plans to take full advantage of the sprawling 17,000-square foot, two-floor space. ""Once restaurants are given the OK to open in NYC,"" he said, ""we can start to open some parts of Slate.""

For bars with live music, like Howl at the Moon in San Antonio, COVID-19 could silence the big, bustling crowds that scribble down song requests and pass the papers up through the bar to the stage.

Denise Ramirez, a musician who plays piano at the hopping venue on the San Antonio Riverwalk, told ABC News that after three years there she has a different perspective for what a new normal could mean.

""Howl is typically a packed house, especially on weekends when we get a lot of bachelorette parties and birthday parties booking up tables,"" she said.

The music-centric bar has 14 different locations in the U.S. and has to keep track of ""all the different regulations being put in place by different state and local governments,"" Ramirez explained. ""I can only assume that's only made it more difficult for them as a company to figure out what they're going to do.""

""Their plan is to wait until bars can open at a full capacity or near-full capacity, because in their words, 'Howl has to be Howl,' which makes sense to me,"" the pianist said. ""I've been part of a now-closed Howl establishment in New York City and have seen what happens if it tries to remain open for only five people on a Tuesday. And I think it's the right move.""

Ramirez and the other entertainers, bartenders, servers and door attendants were furloughed, and she thinks they will ""wait quite a bit before reopening,"" even with the state of Texas currently reopening restaurants at 25% capacity. ""The return to nightlife is going to be a mixed bag. I would expect lots of excitement from everyone having cabin fever, but I'd also expect quite a few rules in place.""

""I don't think anyone wants to be singing on stage with masks on,"" Ramirez said about a discussion with her fellow musician friends. ""We turn to nightlife to escape from our problems, so having a reminder of the pandemic onstage in front of us would kind of defeat that purpose.""

Bar patrons have taken things into their own hands -- shaking up cocktails at home, ordering booze from an app, turning up Bluetooth speakers to listen to a virtual DJ on Instagram live, maybe even while Zooming with friends.  But can that ever fully replace elbowing up to a crowded bar, chatting up a bartender and everything else that comes with a night out?  STOCK PHOTO/Getty Images  In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, with new social distancing requirements and ever-changing, state-by-state safety restrictions, many owners of bars and clubs are waiting with bated breath.  The coveted counter space and tables at Dante -- a famously packed, award-winning cocktail bar and restaurant in New York City -- quickly shifted to slinging specialty drinks via curbside pickup and delivery until restrictions are eased. But the staffers are taking service amid the pandemic ""one day at a time"" until they construct a plan to fully reopen.  The bar at Caffe Dante in New York City in an undated photo before the coronavirus pandemic. Dante/Steve Freihon  ""To be honest, none of us have any idea as to when things will really start to change,"" Linden Pride, owner of the Greenwich Village staple, told ABC News. ""This whole process has pushed us to create a full takeout and delivery menu, as well as cocktails to-go, which has taken us out of our comfort zone to create new, alternative experiences for our guests.""  Pride said he wants to continue the new experiences ""once this is all over."" He and his wife, Natalie, got the idea from a pop-up cocktail event in New Orleans, where people ""drink in a plastic cup and walk down the street."" They found thousands of stickers left over that read, ""'One for the road,' or 'a roadie' as we call it in Australia,"" Pride added.  Tune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.  He hailed New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for quickly recognizing current liquor-licensing regulations that needed to be amended.  ""As soon as the changes were brought into effect, which allowed cocktails to be purchased both for pick-up and delivery, with food, we saw this as an opportunity to try and keep the business operational, which would allow us to retain staff whilst continuing to provide a service to the community,"" Pride told ABC News.  Pride said, ""it's so hard to know"" definitively what service operations at Dante might look like in the future, but that he and his staff are keeping a close eye on operations in other states, including Georgia and Colorado.  ""When we're allowed to open, we will adhere to CDC, WHO and state guidelines,"" Pride said, adding that he's already stocked up on thermometers to check people's temperatures at the door and that he's looking into creating disposable menus and setting up sanitizing stations, in addition to enforcing social distancing.  ""One cool initiative"" he's seen at bars and restaurants in parts of Europe, ""is the extension of outdoor dining -- with some street closures."" Pride said he sees a ""real opportunity in New York"" for designated outdoor dining and drinking areas to enable places on low-traffic streets to set up ""socially distanced tables"" and serve people responsibly.  Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday that the possibility of restaurants and bars opening in the city's streets is ""being very thoroughly discussed"" and ""something we might be able to reach.""  ""I've been talking to restaurant owners ... they're making a great case that this could be a difference-maker,"" de Blasio said. ""You have the right social distancing and protections, the right capacity ... and the right atmosphere. We have to be smart about it."" This could only come after New York City meets the city's indicators for 10 to 14 days and meets the state's indicators, which de Blasio said could be possible in the first half of June.  Pride said that with ""any kind of reopening, it doesn't mean that customers are going to flock to [bars] and fill up those seats."" Dante will look for other inventive options to recreate what Pride calls the ""ritual and experience"" of going out, like ""creating a Friday night takeaway kit"" complete with cocktails and a playlist to give customers the full experience at home.  Pride has also been in contact with close friends in the industry, including the operator of New York's PDT, and said bars and lounges that rely solely on beverages and bottle service will face ""a huge challenge because they don't have full-service kitchens.""  A standard liquor license requires nightclubs and bars to serve food in order to run a full-service beer, wine and liquor operation, according to the New York State Liquor Authority.  Eddie Dean, owner of the Brooklyn club Schimanski, has been through many ups and downs after 30 years in the nightlife business, but he's worried now about bars and clubs.  A bar posts a closed sign in the early evening in Brooklyn after a decree that all bars and restaurants shutdown by 8 pm, in New York City, on March 16, 2020, as much of the nation takes extra precautions due to the coronavirus outbreak. Spencer Platt/Getty Images  ""These businesses are built on volume. A very large percentage of small bars and restaurants pretty much go week to week hoping to make payroll,"" he told ABC News. ""I imagine a high percentage of New York City-based hospitality businesses will not reopen -- or open but not be able to sustain. It's going to be ugly.""  Schimanski ""acted fast to close down"" -- perishable items cleaned out, sound equipment covered, employees furloughed. Dean now is having ""preliminary conversations"" with the landlord to ""get through this mess as best as possible.""  Inside Brooklyn, New York nightclub, Schimanski, in an undated photo before the coronavirus pandemic. Schimanski  ""So far,"" he added, ""I have not heard anything positive for clubs. Any notion of opening at 25 or 50% capacity or even 75% isn't realistic. We will do what it takes to ensure the safety of our staff and all our guests.""  Even amid the current difficulties, Dean said there have been silver linings, like staying in touch with his team and ""thinking of new ideas and concepts."" And being able to rest a bit ""has been welcome.""  ""Anyone who knows me knows I love a good challenge. This is certainly a big challenge. I can't wait to get back and do great things,"" he added.

Among the many lessons of the coronavirus pandemic is how close humans are to the rest of the animal kingdom. We get diseases from other animals, and then we use more animals to figure out how to stop the diseases. As research ramps up treatments and vaccines, animals are crucial to fighting the pandemic.
There are different animals at each end of the pandemic, of course. The new disease almost certainly began with a bat virus, scientists agree. That virus probably passed through another animal, perhaps pangolins, on its way to humans.
But the animals that scientists will depend on in the lab are mice, first of all, and then perhaps ferrets or hamsters or monkeys. Around the world, different laboratories are racing to breed stocks of mice genetically engineered for research and testing the susceptibility of other animals to infection with the virus that causes Covid-19.
There are, of course, many objections to animal testing, particularly when it comes to primates, but researchers are deeply concerned about the hazards to humans of treatments or vaccines that have not been tried on other animals first.
No single kind of animal will serve all test purposes and scientists have several criteria for what makes an animal useful in testing therapies and vaccines for effectiveness.
First, it must be susceptible to infection, and not all animals are. Despite the quarantining of one dog in Hong Kong, with a ‚Äúweak positive‚Äù test for coronavirus, various health agencies are not taking a single, ambiguous result as evidence for concern. Advisories state there is no evidence yet that pets are susceptible to the disease.
And even when laboratory animals are susceptible to infection, that doesn‚Äôt mean they get sick. ‚ÄúMost of them, they don‚Äôt care at all that they‚Äôre infected,‚Äù said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a microbiologist at the University of Iowa who developed a mouse in 2003 that was susceptible to infection with the SARS virus. It is called the hACE2 mouse.
If an animal doesn‚Äôt get sick from the infection, its use is limited, because testing treatment effectiveness requires observing whether the treatment stops the symptoms.
The best laboratory animal would not only get infected and get sick, but get sick in the same way that humans do, showing a similar course of disease. Then a test would give the most information.
Dr. Perlman pointed out that the hACE2 strain of mice susceptible to SARS got sick, ‚Äúbut developed a brain disease‚Äù in addition to other symptoms. A new study from China, not yet peer-reviewed, suggests that these mice do get infected with the new pandemic virus, which is called SARS-CoV-2, and develop mild pneumonia. The paper made no mention of the virus affecting the brain.
This strain of mice will be used in some of the first laboratory experiments. But first it is necessary to breed them. Like many other genetically engineered mice varieties, scientists don‚Äôt keep live colonies on hand. Instead the mice‚Äôs frozen sperm and embryos are kept ready.
The hACE2 mice were put on ice when the SARS outbreak stopped in the early 2000s. Chien-Te Tseng at the University of Texas Medical Branch, who independently developed an hACE2 mouse, is now building up a colony from frozen embryos in his lab. Mice have a three-week gestation period, or pregnancy, and take eight weeks to reach sexual maturity.
Dr. Perlman is not rejuvenating the strain himself. He sent 16 vials of frozen sperm to the Jackson Laboratory in Maine, one of the biggest breeders of laboratory animals, so they can ramp up their production.
They hope to have mice ready for distribution, at cost, by May, according to Cat Lutz, director of the mouse repository, with responsibility for thousands of strains of mice, including the hACE2.
The advantage of this strain is that it has a human receptor on its cells called an ACE2 receptor, thus its name. That allows it to be infected with SARS and the new coronavirus, which both target that receptor as they try to invade cells.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a huge demand,‚Äù Dr. Lutz said, ‚Äúnot only in the United States, but globally.‚ÄùDr. Lutz said that researchers at the Jackson Laboratory will also be investigating other ways to make mice more susceptible to the new coronavirus.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs never only one mouse model that we use.‚Äù For diabetes she said, ‚Äúwe have eight different models that we‚Äôll look at depending on the answer that we want to ask. And I think the same is going to be true in this circumstance as well.‚Äù
Dr. Michael Diamond, in infectious disease specialist at Washington University in St. Louis, is also planning to do research with the hACE2 mouse, and other strains.
He said that although mice take time to breed, creating a supply of them is still quicker than using larger animals. Mice, he said, may help scientists ‚Äúto sort of winnow down some of the candidates‚Äù for vaccines.
Dr. Diamond also said that groups around the globe are pursuing many of the same goals. At first it might seem redundant, but because there are so many unanticipated problems that arise in vaccine and treatment tests, redundancy is a feature of the scientific process rather than a drawback.
Inevitably, he said, vaccine and treatment researchers will move to other animals, perhaps hamsters and ferrets, but certainly monkeys, which are most likely to replicate how the disease progresses in humans. All work with the live virus takes place in level 3 biosecure labs, Dr. Diamond said.
Dave O‚ÄôConnor, a pathologist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, is working with colleagues to test the usefulness of monkeys in the study of coronavirus treatments. He said that a Chinese group had already published some data on rhesus macaques and he had heard that more results from other labs around the world would be coming soon.
Those results would be on the suitability of primates for laboratory tests, not on immediate cures. ‚ÄúThis is not the movie ‚ÄòContagion‚Äô where there will be a magic discovery in a monkey that allows everyone to recover immediately,‚Äù he said.
He added that, ‚ÄúWe are potentially going to be dealing with this for a really long time and need to come to better terms with that.‚Äù",Left,USA,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,These Lab Animals Will Help Fight Coronavirus,"Among the many lessons of the coronavirus pandemic is how close humans are to the rest of the animal kingdom.

This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

As we look for sensible ways to jump-start the battered U.S. economy, which industries should reopen first, and which would you reopen last?

Dr. Tom Frieden: Things that can open first include lower-risk physical businesses like restaurants doing takeout and outdoor recreation. Day care, as well, is enormously important economically, and may be able to reopen relatively soon in this process as long as you keep vulnerable staff and children out and make it clear that children and staff participating could potentially be exposed.

The places that are hardest are places where lots of people are indoors and there is limited space, or where there is lots of travel. Bars, the tourism industry, conventions, conferences, some cultural events, some indoor sporting events are going to be really tough. There may be a way for sporting events with few or no in-person spectators and cultural events with masks on the audience, hand sanitizer and potentially other safety and sanitary features to get back to a newer reality, but it isn't going to be easy.

We have to be careful about things that can backfire if we end up coming out too soon and that result in the substantial spread of the virus. That will be counterproductive to the reopening of the economy.

How will workplaces need to adapt? What will the office of the future look like, for instance?

I do think that, until we have either a vaccine or a highly effective treatment, the workplace will be different. We are going to have to reimagine the workplace and its design for the new reality. That will mean less travel, more telework and fewer meetings. When we do go back to our offices, there will be mandatory hand sanitizer as we enter, no common snack rooms. We'll be physically distancing, even at work, for the foreseeable future.

We will be physically distancing in meetings, and we will avoid communal gatherings. We'll be ensuring people don't come to work sick. De-densifying will be a big part of it ‚Äî also splitting schedules, days, hours and travel, which defeats the purpose of having people together in one space. But it's a way of starting that limits the risk.

Do you expect many of these changes to be permanent, or only temporary until the virus is under control?

I predict we will see permanent work-from-home options. A lot of people will realize they don't need to rent expensive office space when people can work from home with a similar level of efficiency. I do think more telework and less travel are here to stay for a while. I also think we are inevitably going to see more travel restrictions, and potentially 14-day quarantines when you go to a new country. It's very old-fashioned ‚Äî it goes back half a millennium or more. But if your country or state or province has gone through a tremendous effort to control the virus, you won't want to allow the unlimited travel of people who may unwittingly spread the virus in your country.

We are also going to have to better accommodate people who are vulnerable to the disease ‚Äî the elderly and people with underlying health conditions. People who are particularly vulnerable will stay out longer if they can telework. If they can't, they'll need some form of disability so we can get back to work sooner without risking the health of the most vulnerable, and so they don't pay the economic price for that.

You are currently president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, a global non-profit that works to prevent death from cardiovascular disease and to stop epidemics. What kinds of changes will you make within your own workplace?

[We redid] our workplace a year ago at Resolve To Save Lives, which is housed within Vital Strategies, and it's largely open plan. There are partitions between desks, but there are lots of small meeting rooms. That's a problem as we put plans in place to reopen. We'll have to convert meeting rooms to individual offices or seal them off, because you can't have small meeting rooms where you are sitting one foot away from each other and have multiple people using the same room throughout the course of day ‚Äî that's not safe. We have two conference rooms that are large enough for a small meeting with people sitting far apart from one another. We'll have to change the other conference rooms to offices.

Ex-CDC director outlines four key measures to ""go back to new normal""

What are the risks ‚Äî to public health in the U.S. and to the economy ‚Äî of reopening too quickly?

We are all anxious to get back out into the new normal, and there are some activities we can do with little-to-no risk. Outdoor activities, for example, are far less risky than indoor activities. But the risk is that if we reopen too soon, we will rekindle infections. It won't be a question of a second wave, but many waves. No one knows how the virus will behave in warm weather. There may be less risk or there may not be. But still, the vast majority of Americans are vulnerable to this virus.

We do have to balance our economy and public health measures, and what we found from around the country and around the world is that the places that implemented public health measures the best also protect their economy the best.

There is a misconception that the major economic harm is from the government orders to stay at home. That's actually not necessarily the case. People are understandably afraid that if they go out to the store, they could get an infection that kills them or a vulnerable parent. Even where physical distancing recommendations are reduced, there is a delay in people going back out. The bigger issue is that we have to come to terms with the fact that this is a bad pandemic and it's just the beginning of a long fight against it.

Many small businesses have been seriously hurt by the shutdown and are understandably eager to reopen their doors. What's your message to them?

If your customers die from an infection they get in your shop, it's not good for your business. So it's in everyone's interest to make a business as safe as possible.

This is not about public health versus the economy. In order to make the economy healthier, we need to control the virus. It's also in the interest of business people to have a strong public health system, so people who may be brewing infection are warned and quarantined and don't come into your shop, and people who are infected are identified and isolated so they don't spread it. The more we box the virus in, the more space there is for us in society.

How important a role will contact tracing play in reopening the economy?

Contact tracing will be very important. We have this blunt tool, which is sheltering in place, and that really drives down the spread of the virus. Then we have more precise but not as strong tools. One toolset is the way we design [workplaces] for the age of COVID, which includes no-touch doors, no-touch elevators and no-touch hand sanitizer. We have partitions and other design solutions to make a safer world.

Another set of inventions are precise tools that are the ""Box It In"" tools. They are to test, isolate, contact trace and quarantine ‚Äî those are the four corners of our box. If any corner of that box is weak, the virus can get out and spread, but if you are in a workplace and there is a case [of COVID-19] you have to follow the exposure protocols.

How many contact tracers will we need?

If the ratio of contact tracers needed in the U.S. is the same as the number they used in Wuhan, China, it would be about 300,000 people. The exact number depends on the number of cases and the efficiency of the process ‚Äî how readily people cooperate with the process.

I also think it's important to emphasize that contact tracing is not a simple job. There is a misconception that anyone can do it. It's a hard job that requires people skills, medical knowledge, resourcefulness, the ability to reach people and establish, build and maintain trust. You should also be tech-savvy to reach people and identify their contacts. It will be a major facilitator of economic recovery from the pandemic perspective.

Do you agree with the plan President Trump has set out for gradually reopening the economy, or are we being too hasty?

I think the guidelines outlined by the White House were sensible. They outlined things that are important to track in order to know we are not likely to have an explosion of cases when we reopen.

On the other hand, people are very impatient to go out, and there hasn't been a consistent and clear explanation to the public of what the reasons are for having to stay apart or having to continue to refrain from certain activities. I think that reflects messaging that hasn't been consistent and science-based. If people are impatient to go out, you hope at least when they go out, they will do so as safely as possible.",Left-center,USA,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Former CDC chief Tom Frieden warns of ""many waves"" of COVID-19 if economy reopens too soon","CBS MoneyWatch spoke with Dr. Tom Frieden, who was director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2009-2017, about the challenge of reopening the American economy even as COVID-19 deaths continue to climb and before any effective treatments are available to combat the disease. This interview has been edited for clarity and length.  As we look for sensible ways to jump-start the battered U.S. economy, which industries should reopen first, and which would you reopen last?  Dr. Tom Frieden: Things that can open first include lower-risk physical businesses like restaurants doing takeout and outdoor recreation. Day care, as well, is enormously important economically, and may be able to reopen relatively soon in this process as long as you keep vulnerable staff and children out and make it clear that children and staff participating could potentially be exposed.  The places that are hardest are places where lots of people are indoors and there is limited space, or where there is lots of travel. Bars, the tourism industry, conventions, conferences, some cultural events, some indoor sporting events are going to be really tough. There may be a way for sporting events with few or no in-person spectators and cultural events with masks on the audience, hand sanitizer and potentially other safety and sanitary features to get back to a newer reality, but it isn't going to be easy.  We have to be careful about things that can backfire if we end up coming out too soon and that result in the substantial spread of the virus. That will be counterproductive to the reopening of the economy.  How will workplaces need to adapt? What will the office of the future look like, for instance?  I do think that, until we have either a vaccine or a highly effective treatment, the workplace will be different. We are going to have to reimagine the workplace and its design for the new reality. That will mean less travel, more telework and fewer meetings. When we do go back to our offices, there will be mandatory hand sanitizer as we enter, no common snack rooms. We'll be physically distancing, even at work, for the foreseeable future.  We will be physically distancing in meetings, and we will avoid communal gatherings. We'll be ensuring people don't come to work sick. De-densifying will be a big part of it ‚Äî also splitting schedules, days, hours and travel, which defeats the purpose of having people together in one space. But it's a way of starting that limits the risk.  Do you expect many of these changes to be permanent, or only temporary until the virus is under control?  I predict we will see permanent work-from-home options. A lot of people will realize they don't need to rent expensive office space when people can work from home with a similar level of efficiency. I do think more telework and less travel are here to stay for a while. I also think we are inevitably going to see more travel restrictions, and potentially 14-day quarantines when you go to a new country. It's very old-fashioned ‚Äî it goes back half a millennium or more. But if your country or state or province has gone through a tremendous effort to control the virus, you won't want to allow the unlimited travel of people who may unwittingly spread the virus in your country.  We are also going to have to better accommodate people who are vulnerable to the disease ‚Äî the elderly and people with underlying health conditions. People who are particularly vulnerable will stay out longer if they can telework. If they can't, they'll need some form of disability so we can get back to work sooner without risking the health of the most vulnerable, and so they don't pay the economic price for that.  You are currently president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, a global non-profit that works to prevent death from cardiovascular disease and to stop epidemics. What kinds of changes will you make within your own workplace?  [We redid] our workplace a year ago at Resolve To Save Lives, which is housed within Vital Strategies, and it's largely open plan. There are partitions between desks, but there are lots of small meeting rooms. That's a problem as we put plans in place to reopen. We'll have to convert meeting rooms to individual offices or seal them off, because you can't have small meeting rooms where you are sitting one foot away from each other and have multiple people using the same room throughout the course of day ‚Äî that's not safe. We have two conference rooms that are large enough for a small meeting with people sitting far apart from one another. We'll have to change the other conference rooms to offices.  Ex-CDC director outlines four key measures to ""go back to new normal""  What are the risks ‚Äî to public health in the U.S. and to the economy ‚Äî of reopening too quickly?  We are all anxious to get back out into the new normal, and there are some activities we can do with little-to-no risk. Outdoor activities, for example, are far less risky than indoor activities. But the risk is that if we reopen too soon, we will rekindle infections. It won't be a question of a second wave, but many waves. No one knows how the virus will behave in warm weather. There may be less risk or there may not be. But still, the vast majority of Americans are vulnerable to this virus.  We do have to balance our economy and public health measures, and what we found from around the country and around the world is that the places that implemented public health measures the best also protect their economy the best.  There is a misconception that the major economic harm is from the government orders to stay at home. That's actually not necessarily the case. People are understandably afraid that if they go out to the store, they could get an infection that kills them or a vulnerable parent. Even where physical distancing recommendations are reduced, there is a delay in people going back out. The bigger issue is that we have to come to terms with the fact that this is a bad pandemic and it's just the beginning of a long fight against it.  Many small businesses have been seriously hurt by the shutdown and are understandably eager to reopen their doors. What's your message to them?  If your customers die from an infection they get in your shop, it's not good for your business. So it's in everyone's interest to make a business as safe as possible.  This is not about public health versus the economy. In order to make the economy healthier, we need to control the virus. It's also in the interest of business people to have a strong public health system, so people who may be brewing infection are warned and quarantined and don't come into your shop, and people who are infected are identified and isolated so they don't spread it. The more we box the virus in, the more space there is for us in society.  How important a role will contact tracing play in reopening the economy?  Contact tracing will be very important. We have this blunt tool, which is sheltering in place, and that really drives down the spread of the virus. Then we have more precise but not as strong tools. One toolset is the way we design [workplaces] for the age of COVID, which includes no-touch doors, no-touch elevators and no-touch hand sanitizer. We have partitions and other design solutions to make a safer world.  Another set of inventions are precise tools that are the ""Box It In"" tools. They are to test, isolate, contact trace and quarantine ‚Äî those are the four corners of our box. If any corner of that box is weak, the virus can get out and spread, but if you are in a workplace and there is a case [of COVID-19] you have to follow the exposure protocols.  How many contact tracers will we need?  If the ratio of contact tracers needed in the U.S. is the same as the number they used in Wuhan, China, it would be about 300,000 people. The exact number depends on the number of cases and the efficiency of the process ‚Äî how readily people cooperate with the process.

The parcel giant is limiting how much retailers like Kohl's and Nordstrom can ship, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal.

It shows how much store closures from the coronavirus are shifting Americans to online orders, even of nonessential items, and how it's overwhelming delivery giants.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

If your order from Nordstrom, Kohl's, Bed Bath & Beyond, DSW, or Hobby Lobby is moving at an unexpectedly sluggish pace, FedEx may be the reason.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that FedEx is so overwhelmed with online orders that it's capping shipments from some two dozen retailers until at least May 19. The companies whose orders FedEx has capped include Belk, Abercrombie & Fitch, Kohl's, Bed Bath & Beyond, Eddie Bauer, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Hobby Lobby, and DSW.

""These customers have seen significant volume growth since the spread of Covid-19,"" FedEx told Ground workers in a memo leaked to the Journal. ""In a time of already high volume growth, capping the number of packages to be picked up at these locations will limit any negative impacts to the FedEx Ground network.""

A FedEx spokesperson told Business Insider these limits are similar to what the company mandates around Christmas time, ensuring reliable service. The company is working directly with large retailers with unusually-high volume to ensure goods are getting out on time.

Some customers are directly passing their goods to a their closest-by FedEx Ground facility to bypass hub sortation, the spokesperson added. The parcel giant has also increased Sunday delivery, and, in certain locations, hiring.

Americans are now buying (nonessential) stuff online

Earlier this year, Americans shifted to buying household goods, groceries, and essential supplies online. Online sales of hand sanitizer jumped by 228% in the US during the four weeks ending on March 7, compared to the same period last year, according to retail sales tracker Nielsen.

Adobe Analytics said a 100% increase in online grocery orders in mid March drove a 25% uptick in overall online orders, compared to a period earlier in the month.

But as the government-mandated shutdowns from the coronavirus have endured, people are starting to buy more and more of those less essential goods that retailers like Nordstrom or DSW might hawk.

""It went from people trying to stock up and maybe buying a little bit more than they needed to understanding that things are OK, I can move beyond the basics of food and shelter,"" Jaimee Minney, senior vice president of marketing and public relations at market-research firm Rakuten Intelligence, told CNBC.

Rakuten Intelligence found for the first half of April, compared to the first half of March, Americans bought nearly nine times as many books, nearly three times as many toys and games, and more than twice as many sports and outdoors items. Purchases of beauty products upticked by 38%.

Meanwhile, those who are seeing their states reopen may start to consider the ensembles they may need for garden parties or weddings, suggested a recent white paper from Pinterest.

The shift to online is whelming UPS, FedEx, and Amazon

Americans have shifted to ordering more online for years, but the coronavirus pandemic is accelerating that. Sales online popped by 49% in April, according to Adobe Analytics.

And while an unexpected deluge of packages may buoy delivery companies, the FedEx shipping cap shows it's also disruptive to normal business activities. UPS and Amazon have seen disruptions, too.

UPS said it delivered 19% more packages to homebound Americans in the first three months of 2020 compared to last year. But the increase in residential over commercial deliveries ended up eroding UPS' margins.

Meanwhile, Amazon was forced to halt all third-party package shipments last month, and had to ban warehouse deliveries of nonessential goods in March.

Many experts believe that increase will stick. As a result, parcel giants must now piece together how to deliver more boxes on doorsteps than ever before.

""The No. 1 thing that we have seen is an explosion in e-commerce due to the physical store closures,"" Brie Carere, FedEx chief marketing and communications officer, told eMarketer. ""If we thought e-commerce was growing faster before, we're going to see even greater acceleration.""",Left-center,USA,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,FedEx is so slammed with online orders that it's reportedly capping shipments from major retailers like Nordstrom and Hobby Lobby,"FedEx is fielding an unusually high number of online orders.

It's powwow season ‚Äî the time of year when across the country, Native American tribes should be getting together to celebrate their culture with food, dancing, singing and drumming. Kay Oxendine is a member of the Haliwa Saponi Tribe in North Carolina.

""Every year we know it's coming; like, the birds sing differently,"" she told NPR. ""It's almost like spring arrives when the powwow does.""

Oxendine is an author and educator and the mistress of ceremonies for a number of powwows in the eastern U.S. It's a job she loves: telling stories to the crowd and introducing the dancers, singers and drummers. She was set to be the first woman to emcee her tribe's powwow, scheduled for Friday, April 17, to Sunday April 19, at the Tribal Ceremonial Grounds in Hollister, N.C.

About 5,000 people would've been there, but she knew it would be canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. What she says she didn't expect was that her mind and body were still expecting the celebration.

""So I wake up on Friday morning and it's like I wake up and I open my eyes and I'm looking, oh, my God, it's here! Literally was like a kid. And I jumped out of bed, and I'm like YAY, and I said to my son, it's powwow time. And he was like, 'Mom.' ""

She felt physically ill.

""I actually threw up. I actually I got physically ill. It felt like I was pregnant but couldn't give birth.""

Then, she says she noticed on Facebook that a member of the Haliwa Saponi Tribal Council had scheduled a virtual Haliwa powwow. ""And I'm like, man, you know, stop, what are you doing?"" It seemed like such a strange idea.

But she says it was wonderful ""because what she did, she encouraged people to still dress in their regalia. And so one of our previous tribal administrators, Archie Lynch, who is also my cousin, he lit a fire and he was out there and he had sage. He was blessing the grounds. It was in his backyard. But, you know, it just meant the world to me.""

Following the powwow, there's normally an after party with a deejay. This year, one of the tribal members held a virtual after party.

""We were brought up on Otis Redding and soul music around here ‚Äî music that just makes you want to get up and dance,"" she says.

So Oxendine got up and danced.

""I'm sitting in my room, the music is blasting. I'm sitting in front of my computer, I'm dancing in my living room. My son thinks I've lost my mind. ""

It was just what her spirit needed.

Opioid addiction isn't taking a break during the coronavirus pandemic.

But the U.S. response to the viral crisis is making addiction treatment easier to get.

Under the national emergency declared by the Trump administration in March, the government has suspended a federal law that required patients to have an in-person visit with a physician before they could be prescribed drugs that help quell withdrawal symptoms, such as Suboxone. Patients can now get those prescriptions via a phone call or videoconference with a doctor.

Addiction experts have been calling for that change for years to help expand access for patients in many parts of the country that have shortages of physicians eligible to prescribe these medication-assisted treatments. A federal report in January found that 40% of U.S. counties don't have a single health care provider approved to prescribe buprenorphine, an active ingredient in Suboxone.

A 2018 law called for the new policy, but regulations were never finalized.

""I wish there was another way to get this done besides a pandemic,"" says Dr. David Kan, chief medical officer of Bright Heart Health, a Walnut Creek, Calif., company. It has recently started working with insurers and health providers to help addicted patients get therapy and medications without having to leave their homes. He said he hopes the administration will make the changes permanent after the national emergency ends.

Years before the emergency regulations were issued, Bright Heart ‚Äî along with several other telemedicine counseling providers ‚Äî began offering opioid addiction treatment and counseling via telemedicine, even if they couldn't prescribe initial medication for addiction. Patients can renew prescriptions for drugs to deal with withdrawal symptoms, get drug-tested and meet with counselors for therapy.

When Nathan Post needed help overcoming a decade-long drug addiction, he went online in 2018 and used Bright Heart Health to connect to a doctor and weekly individual and group counseling sessions. He says the convenience is a big benefit.

""As an addict, it was easy to have excuses not to do stuff, but this was easy because I could just be in my living room and turn on my computer, so I had no reason to blow it off,"" he says.

Post, 38, a tattoo artist who recently moved from New Mexico to Iowa City, Iowa, was addicted to Suboxone, the drug he was prescribed in 2009 to deal with an addiction to opioid pills.

Officials with the insurer Anthem say Bright Heart's telemedicine option has helped increase medication-assisted treatment for members with opioid drug abuse issues from 16% to more than 30% in California and nine other states. While fewer than 5% of Anthem patients seeking addiction treatment use telemedicine, the company expects the option to become more common.

One barometer of the effectiveness of the care, Bright Heart Health officials say, is that 90% of patients are still in treatment after 30 days and 65% after 90 days ‚Äî far higher than with traditional treatment.

Several insurers across the country ‚Äî including Aetna and Blue Cross Blue Shield companies such as Anthem ‚Äî have begun covering the telemedicine addiction service.

Dr. Miriam Komaromy, medical director of Boston Medical Center's Grayken Center for Addiction, says there are some downsides to virtual care.

""I think therapists and providers do worry whether it provides the same level of engagement with the patient and whether it's possible to gauge someone's sincerity and level of motivation as easily over a camera as in person,"" she says.

Nonetheless, she predicts telemedicine service will grow because of the tremendous need to broaden access to mental health and addiction counseling. ""Too often the default is no counseling for patients,"" she said. ""This gives us another set of tools.""

Patients can also have trouble finding a doctor who is eligible to prescribe medication to help treat addiction. Physicians are required to get a federal license to prescribe Suboxone and other controlled substances that help patients with opioid addiction, and they can write only limited numbers of prescriptions each month. Many doctors hesitate to seek that qualification.

A few small studies have found that patients are as likely to stay with telemedicine treatment as with in-person care for drug addiction. But no studies have determined whether one type of therapy is more effective.

Telemedicine does have its limits, and it is not right for everyone, particularly patients who require more intensive inpatient care or who lack easy Internet access, Komaromy says.

Premera Blue Cross and Blue Shield officials say they are partnering with Boulder Care, a digital recovery program based in Portland, Ore., to help customers in rural Alaska. ""Telemedicine is a unique way for someone to go through treatment in a discreet manner,"" says Rick Abbott, a Premera vice president.

While telemedicine has been growing in popularity for physical medicine, some people may still be reluctant to use it for drug addiction.

There are also concerns that allowing providers to prescribe controlled substances without meeting patients in person could increase the risk of fraud.

""There is a fear around this that there may be some rogue providers who make a lot of money off addiction and will do it stealthily on the Internet,"" says Dr. Alyson Smith, an addiction medicine specialist with Boulder Care. ""While that is a small risk, we have to compare it to the huge benefit of expanding treatment that will save lives.""

Smith says she doesn't notice a big difference in treating patients for drug addiction in her office compared with on a video screen. She can still see patients' pupils to make sure they are dilated and ask patients about how they are feeling ‚Äî physical and emotional signs that can help determine whether it's appropriate to prescribe certain drugs. Dilated pupils are a sign of patients suffering from withdrawal from heroin and other drugs.

Dr. Dawn Abriel, who treated Post and previously directed a methadone clinic in Albuquerque, N.M., says she can diagnose patients over video without issue.

""I can pick up an awful lot on the video,"" particularly a patient's body language, she says. ""I think people open up to me more because they are sitting in their homes and in their place of comfort.""

In West Virginia, one of the states hardest hit by the opioid addiction epidemic, Highmark, a Blue Cross Blue Shield company, started offering telehealth addiction coverage with Bright Heart Health in January. Highmark officials say a lack of health providers, particularly in rural parts of the state, meant that many of the insurer's members had difficulty finding the help they needed.

Dr. Caesar DeLeo, vice president and executive medical director of strategic initiatives for Highmark, says the insurer had been having problems getting customers into care. Only about a third of members with addiction issues were receiving treatment, he says.

""We needed to address the crisis with a new approach,"" DeLeo says. ""This will give people more options and give primary care doctors who do not want to prescribe Suboxone another place to refer patients.""

DeLeo says patients will also be referred to Bright Heart in hospital emergency rooms.

Dr. Paul Leonard, an emergency doctor and medical director for Workit Health, an Ann Arbor, Mich., company offering telemedicine treatment and counseling programs, says many patients who turn to ERs for addiction treatment get little help finding counseling.

With online therapy, patients can sign up while still in the ER.

""We've built a better mousetrap,"" Leonard says.

Providers who specialize in addiction medicine and have recently turned to telemedicine say they and their patients are getting more accustomed to virtual care.

But the U.S. response to the viral crisis is making addiction treatment easier to get.  Under the national emergency declared by the Trump administration in March, the government has suspended a federal law that required patients to have an in-person visit with a physician before they could be prescribed drugs that help quell withdrawal symptoms, such as Suboxone. Patients can now get those prescriptions via a phone call or videoconference with a doctor.  Addiction experts have been calling for that change for years to help expand access for patients in many parts of the country that have shortages of physicians eligible to prescribe these medication-assisted treatments. A federal report in January found that 40% of U.S. counties don't have a single health care provider approved to prescribe buprenorphine, an active ingredient in Suboxone.  A 2018 law called for the new policy, but regulations were never finalized.  ""I wish there was another way to get this done besides a pandemic,"" says Dr. David Kan, chief medical officer of Bright Heart Health, a Walnut Creek, Calif., company. It has recently started working with insurers and health providers to help addicted patients get therapy and medications without having to leave their homes. He said he hopes the administration will make the changes permanent after the national emergency ends.  Years before the emergency regulations were issued, Bright Heart ‚Äî along with several other telemedicine counseling providers ‚Äî began offering opioid addiction treatment and counseling via telemedicine, even if they couldn't prescribe initial medication for addiction. Patients can renew prescriptions for drugs to deal with withdrawal symptoms, get drug-tested and meet with counselors for therapy.  When Nathan Post needed help overcoming a decade-long drug addiction, he went online in 2018 and used Bright Heart Health to connect to a doctor and weekly individual and group counseling sessions. He says the convenience is a big benefit.  ""As an addict, it was easy to have excuses not to do stuff, but this was easy because I could just be in my living room and turn on my computer, so I had no reason to blow it off,"" he says.  Post, 38, a tattoo artist who recently moved from New Mexico to Iowa City, Iowa, was addicted to Suboxone, the drug he was prescribed in 2009 to deal with an addiction to opioid pills.  Officials with the insurer Anthem say Bright Heart's telemedicine option has helped increase medication-assisted treatment for members with opioid drug abuse issues from 16% to more than 30% in California and nine other states. While fewer than 5% of Anthem patients seeking addiction treatment use telemedicine, the company expects the option to become more common.  One barometer of the effectiveness of the care, Bright Heart Health officials say, is that 90% of patients are still in treatment after 30 days and 65% after 90 days ‚Äî far higher than with traditional treatment.  Several insurers across the country ‚Äî including Aetna and Blue Cross Blue Shield companies such as Anthem ‚Äî have begun covering the telemedicine addiction service.  Dr. Miriam Komaromy, medical director of Boston Medical Center's Grayken Center for Addiction, says there are some downsides to virtual care.  ""I think therapists and providers do worry whether it provides the same level of engagement with the patient and whether it's possible to gauge someone's sincerity and level of motivation as easily over a camera as in person,"" she says.  Nonetheless, she predicts telemedicine service will grow because of the tremendous need to broaden access to mental health and addiction counseling. ""Too often the default is no counseling for patients,"" she said. ""This gives us another set of tools.""  Patients can also have trouble finding a doctor who is eligible to prescribe medication to help treat addiction. Physicians are required to get a federal license to prescribe Suboxone and other controlled substances that help patients with opioid addiction, and they can write only limited numbers of prescriptions each month. Many doctors hesitate to seek that qualification.  A few small studies have found that patients are as likely to stay with telemedicine treatment as with in-person care for drug addiction. But no studies have determined whether one type of therapy is more effective.  Telemedicine does have its limits, and it is not right for everyone, particularly patients who require more intensive inpatient care or who lack easy Internet access, Komaromy says.  Premera Blue Cross and Blue Shield officials say they are partnering with Boulder Care, a digital recovery program based in Portland, Ore., to help customers in rural Alaska. ""Telemedicine is a unique way for someone to go through treatment in a discreet manner,"" says Rick Abbott, a Premera vice president.  While telemedicine has been growing in popularity for physical medicine, some people may still be reluctant to use it for drug addiction.  There are also concerns that allowing providers to prescribe controlled substances without meeting patients in person could increase the risk of fraud.  ""There is a fear around this that there may be some rogue providers who make a lot of money off addiction and will do it stealthily on the Internet,"" says Dr. Alyson Smith, an addiction medicine specialist with Boulder Care. ""While that is a small risk, we have to compare it to the huge benefit of expanding treatment that will save lives.""  Smith says she doesn't notice a big difference in treating patients for drug addiction in her office compared with on a video screen. She can still see patients' pupils to make sure they are dilated and ask patients about how they are feeling ‚Äî physical and emotional signs that can help determine whether it's appropriate to prescribe certain drugs. Dilated pupils are a sign of patients suffering from withdrawal from heroin and other drugs.  Dr. Dawn Abriel, who treated Post and previously directed a methadone clinic in Albuquerque, N.M., says she can diagnose patients over video without issue.  ""I can pick up an awful lot on the video,"" particularly a patient's body language, she says. ""I think people open up to me more because they are sitting in their homes and in their place of comfort.""  In West Virginia, one of the states hardest hit by the opioid addiction epidemic, Highmark, a Blue Cross Blue Shield company, started offering telehealth addiction coverage with Bright Heart Health in January. Highmark officials say a lack of health providers, particularly in rural parts of the state, meant that many of the insurer's members had difficulty finding the help they needed.  Dr. Caesar DeLeo, vice president and executive medical director of strategic initiatives for Highmark, says the insurer had been having problems getting customers into care. Only about a third of members with addiction issues were receiving treatment, he says.  ""We needed to address the crisis with a new approach,"" DeLeo says. ""This will give people more options and give primary care doctors who do not want to prescribe Suboxone another place to refer patients.""  DeLeo says patients will also be referred to Bright Heart in hospital emergency rooms.  Dr. Paul Leonard, an emergency doctor and medical director for Workit Health, an Ann Arbor, Mich., company offering telemedicine treatment and counseling programs, says many patients who turn to ERs for addiction treatment get little help finding counseling.  With online therapy, patients can sign up while still in the ER.  ""We've built a better mousetrap,"" Leonard says.  Providers who specialize in addiction medicine and have recently turned to telemedicine say they and their patients are getting more accustomed to virtual care.  ""There are always times you wish you could reach out and hold someone's hand, and you can't do that,"" says Boulder's Smith. ""But we feel like we are more skilled at a virtual hand-holding and really connect with people ‚Äî and they feel well supported in return.""

As the pressure to reopen the economy intensifies, business leaders are searching for ways to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection for their workers and customers. An alluring idea is to offer testing on site, keeping those who are positive out of the workplace.

Testing seems to offer a combination of confidence building for employees and liability protection for companies. Some employers are even pursuing mandatory testing, which is permitted by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

So, should universal testing in the workplace become part of the new normal?

Not yet. Given technical and resource limitations, testing is no more than one piece of the puzzle of infection prevention and control. There are three major reasons why it would be a mistake for employers to rely heavily or exclusively on testing for safety:

Social distancing vital even with tests

‚ñ∫Sufficient testing is difficult to put in place at even moderate scale. Testing for active SARS-CoV-2 infection is based on identifying the genetic material of the virus in a sample taken from the back of the throat or the nose. (Saliva testing also is promising.) For one person at a time, with certain machines, results are possible within as little as 15 minutes. When dozens or hundreds of samples are needed, however, samples need to be run in tandem on larger machines, and the results are likely to take hours.

If you ask people to wait a day for the results, that‚Äôs another day when latent infection could manifest itself, and another test would be needed. And so on. New rapid ‚Äúantigen‚Äù tests are unlikely to solve this problem, given weaknesses with their accuracy.

Pooling saliva samples from the whole workplace is a potential way to search for the coronavirus at lower cost. This strategy, however, takes additional time for sample collection and laboratory work. It also requires follow-up testing should the pooled sample prove positive.

‚ñ∫Negative test results do not eliminate the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the workplace. The accuracy of the test depends on when it is performed in an individual‚Äôs course of infection. Many asymptomatic people with SARS-CoV-2 infection could test negative ‚Äî especially if they are in the pre-symptomatic but infectious phase. As a result, even the world‚Äôs most robust testing program would not eliminate the need for social distancing within an office or retail setting. One missed infection in someone who attends a packed staff meeting will require the whole office to quarantine.

COVID protection: Workplaces aren't ready for mass reopening. First we need standards to keep workers safe.

‚ñ∫Employer testing at scale could lead to shortages of testing supplies and compromise the ability of health care facilities to test people who develop symptoms. Consultants offering testing to businesses may go straight to suppliers of swabs, reagents and testing machines and outbid public health agencies and clinics. If even a fraction of workplaces attempts regular testing, the demands could far exceed capacity.

Less testing of those at greatest risk of infection will mean fewer opportunities for isolation, contact tracing and quarantine, the core components of controlling community spread. As cases in a community rise, so too will the likelihood of infections penetrating every workplace.

Sick leave, screenings and ventilation

Rather than as a magic wand, employers should look at testing as a potential piece of a comprehensive infection prevention and control strategy.

Employers should provide generous sick leave and quarantine benefits, screen employees and customers for symptoms before they come to the workplace, and reengineer the work environment to maintain at least 6 feet of distance and high levels of ventilation. They should focus on ways to promote hand hygiene, social distancing, environmental disinfection, and rapid identification and contact tracing for employees who develop COVID-19.

False choice:Protesters should demand coronavirus safety and a reopened economy. We can have both.

Regular testing is most appropriate for small cohorts of people who are unable to socially distance at work and who are exposed to the public in close quarters. Indeed, such testing could prove to be of high utility in very high-risk settings, such as nursing homes. Broad testing is also important in the setting of an outbreak, as directed by public health agencies.

Testing alone, however, is insufficient as an infection prevention and control strategy. A test might find the novel coronavirus, but only careful planning, policy changes, reengineering the workplace and social distancing can stop it from spreading. There are no shortcuts to defeating COVID-19.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin predicted the American economy would rebound in the second half of this year from unemployment rates that rival the Great Depression. Another 3.2 million U.S. workers applied for jobless benefits last week, bringing the total over the last seven weeks to 33.5 million.

‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre going to see a bounce-back from a low standpoint,‚Äù said Mnuchin, speaking on ‚ÄúFox News Sunday.‚Äù

But the director of the University of Washington institute that created a White House-endorsed coronavirus model said the moves by states to re-open businesses ‚Äúwill translate into more cases and deaths in 10 days from now.‚Äù Dr. Christopher Murray of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation said states where cases and deaths are going up more than expected include Illinois, Arizona, Florida and California.

Many families faced their first Mother‚Äôs Day without loved ones lost in the pandemic. Others sent good wishes from a safe distance or through phone and video calls.

The virus has caused particular suffering for the elderly, with more than 26,000 deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, according to an Associated Press tally.

At a senior center in Smyrna, Georgia, 73-year-old Mary Washington spoke to her daughter Courtney Crosby and grandchild Sydney Crosby through a window.

In Grafton, West Virginia, where the tradition of Mother‚Äôs Day began 112 years ago, the brick building now known as the International Mother‚Äôs Day Shrine held its first online-only audience. Anna Jarvis first held a memorial service for her mother and all mothers on the second Sunday of May in 1908.

‚ÄúSheltered safely at home with the family together would be viewed by Anna Jarvis as exactly the way she wanted Mother‚Äôs Day to be observed,‚Äù said Marvin Gelhausen, chairman of the shrine‚Äôs board of trustees, in an address on YouTube.

Matilda Cuomo, the mother of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, called into her son‚Äôs daily briefing so he and his three daughters could wish her a happy Mother‚Äôs Day.

‚ÄúI am so blessed as many mothers today are,‚Äù she said.

Andrew Cuomo, whose state is the deadliest hot spot for the virus in the U.S., said he looked forward to getting back to normal. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have fun, and then you can spend more time with me. I know I am your favorite,‚Äù he said in a playful dig at his siblings.

He also announced two policy reversals a day after an Associated Press report in which residents‚Äô relatives, watchdog groups and politicians from both parties alleged he was not doing enough to counter the surge of deaths in nursing homes, where about 5,300 residents have died. Nursing home staff in New York will now have to undergo COVID-19 tests twice a week and facilities will no longer be required to take in hospital patients who were infected.

The U.S. has seen 1.3 million infections and nearly 80,000 deaths, the most in the world by far, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Worldwide, 4 million people have been reported infected and more than 280,000 have died, over half of them in Europe, according to Johns Hopkins.

In the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a modest easing of the country‚Äôs coronavirus lockdown but urged citizens not to surrender the progress already made. The country has recorded the most virus deaths in Europe at over 31,900.

Those in the construction or manufacturing industries or other jobs that can‚Äôt be done at home ‚Äúshould be actively encouraged to go to work‚Äù this week, he said. Johnson, who has taken a tougher line after falling ill himself with what he called ‚Äúthis devilish illness,‚Äù set a goal of June 1 to begin re-opening schools and shops if the U.K. can control new infections and the transmission rate of each infected person.

‚ÄúWe will be driven not by mere hope or economic necessity,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to be driven by the science, the data, and public health.‚Äù

Germany, which managed to push new infections below 1,000 daily before deciding to loosen restrictions, has seen regional spikes in cases linked to slaughterhouses and nursing homes. Health officials say the number of people each confirmed virus patient infects rose above 1 again, reflecting a renewed increase in cases. The number must be below 1 for outbreaks to decline.

France is letting some younger students go back to school Monday after almost two months out. Attendance won‚Äôt be compulsory right away. Residents of some Spanish regions will be able to enjoy limited seating at bars, restaurants and other public places Monday, but Madrid and Barcelona, the country‚Äôs largest cities, will remain shut down.

China, where the virus was first detected, reported 14 new cases Sunday, its first double-digit rise in 10 days. Eleven of 12 domestic infections were in the northeastern province of Jilin, prompting authorities to raise the threat level in one of its counties, Shulan, to high risk, just days after downgrading all regions to low risk.

Authorities said the Shulan outbreak originated with a 45-year-old woman who had no recent travel or exposure history but spread it to her husband, three sisters and other relatives. Train services in the county were suspended.

‚ÄúEpidemic control and prevention is a serious and complicated matter, and local authorities should never be overly optimistic, war-weary or off-guard,‚Äù said Jilin Communist Party secretary Bayin Chaolu.

South Korea reported 34 more cases as new infections linked to nightclubs threaten its hard-won gains against the virus. It was the first time that South Korea‚Äôs daily infections were above 30 in about a month.

The same month she contracted the novel coronavirus, Wilson-Griffin was finalizing her latest endeavor: creating a maternal triage acuity index for pregnant women.





But on March 20, the day her proposal was scheduled for approval by her academic adviser, Wilson-Griffin succumbed to the virus. The 63-year-old was the first person in St. Louis County to die of covid-19.

She was a ‚Äúgentle driving force for change,‚Äù said Laura Kuensting, her committee chair for her doctor of nursing practice program at the University of Missouri, St. Louis College of Nursing.

‚ÄúHer number one motivation was because she cared about the health of women, especially black women and their babies,‚Äù Kuensting said.

At Barnes Hospital, now BJC Hospital, where Wilson-Griffin worked from 1981 through 2007, she was instrumental in creating the state‚Äôs first maternal transport teams for high-risk pregnant mothers when she learned black women and their babies had a higher mortality rate in the United States.





Her new venture was through her clinical scholarship project for her program, from which she was scheduled to graduate in December.

Kuensting and Wilson-Griffin were scheduled to meet on the evening of March 20 to review the proposal, but when the typically prompt Wilson-Griffin didn‚Äôt arrive on time, concern washed over Keunsting.

She waited about 30 minutes for a response from Wilson-Griffin before tapping into her nursing network, which confirmed Wilson-Griffin‚Äôs death. ‚ÄúI was devastated,‚Äù Keunsting said.

Wilson-Griffin‚Äôs death underscores the disparity with which the virus is ravaging black populations across the country. The grandmother of four had been living with lupus for years, according to her daughter, Valerie Griffin. The disease is three times more common in black women than white women. Wilson-Griffin‚Äôs health history and her age made her more susceptible to complications caused by the virus.





Wilson-Griffin‚Äôs commitment to others had been recognized at all levels by friends, family and also the nursing community, which awarded her the 2019 March of Dimes Missouri Chapter Nurse of the Year in Women‚Äôs Health and Obstetrics .

Her death has left behind a stunned medical community that respected her passion for marginalized women and their unborn children, and a family in pain.

Compassionate caregiver

Wilson-Griffin had a knack for doing the unorthodox for the benefit of those who needed her help, said her longtime friend and colleague Pamela Lesser, director of perinatal services at SSM St. Mary‚Äôs Health Center, where Wilson-Griffin last worked as a perinatal clinical nurse specialist.



The model of care in the 1980s was for newborns to remain in the nursery most of the time after a birth, Lesser said.



Wilson-Griffin told the other hospital staff that the mother was going to take the baby home in a few days, and that the hospital wouldn‚Äôt be caring for the infant after the hospital stay ended, according to Lesser.

‚ÄúThe baby‚Äôs staying in the room because it‚Äôs the right thing to do,‚Äù Lesser remembered Wilson-Griffin saying when a mother wanted her baby in her room overnight.

It wasn‚Äôt the first time her intuition led her to help a patient in an unusual way.

As a U.S. Navy Reserve Nurse Corps member deployed overseas during the Gulf War, she helped a soldier who had endured sleepless nights because he heard voices.



The labor and delivery nurse had no expertise in this kind of medical care, but she wanted to help, Lesser recalled of her friend‚Äôs active-duty time, which also required her to set up a field hospital that had nothing to do with birthing babies.



She told the distressed man that she would put the voices in the refrigerator overnight for him so he could sleep. The young man slept through the night.

‚ÄúShe got in trouble because they said he was going to have a food aversion,‚Äù Lesser told The Washington Post, laughing as she recalled the story.

Wilson-Griffin‚Äôs tenacity for knowledge and advancing patient care inspired other nurses confronting complex problems to think: ‚ÄúWhat would Judy do?‚Äù



Lesser and Wilson-Griffin‚Äôs collaborations on ideas and projects created such a tightknit relationship that the two joked they shared a brain. Sometimes mail would arrive to the hospital addressed to ‚ÄúPamela Wilson‚Äù or ‚ÄúJudy Lesser.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn many ways, she was more like a sister to me,‚Äù Lesser said.

Something about her

Of her achievements, the connection Wilson-Griffin formed with her daughter, Valerie Griffin, was one of her most prized.



Valerie Griffin was in her 20s when she met the woman who eventually became her stepmother. Her father, Tyrone Griffin, had been divorced for years, and his daughter watched him navigate the dating scene. When she met Wilson-Griffin for the first time, Valerie said she ‚Äúloved her instantly.‚Äù



The new woman in her father‚Äôs life had a compelling warm energy that effortlessly won over Griffin and her brother, Tyrone Griffin Jr.

She watched as her father courted Wilson-Griffin, the woman who would offer Valerie Griffin dating advice over dinners and a supportive ear during shopping ventures.

The two women grew closer when Tyrone Sr. became ill with lung cancer in January 1996. She lent her medical expertise to be hands-on with his medical treatment plan and comforted Valerie Griffin throughout her father‚Äôs swift decline. His rapidly devolving health welded the two women together.



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what we would‚Äôve done without her,‚Äù Griffin said.



Tyrone and Judy married in April 1996. He died two months later. She remained a Wilson-Griffin until her last day.

‚ÄúShe loved my father,‚Äù Griffin said. ‚ÄúLoved him.‚Äù

When Griffin‚Äôs mother died three years after her father, Wilson-Griffin salved her daughter‚Äôs loss by becoming the maternal figure young adults need as they try to balance moving through the world and figuring out who they are.

She would be there for Griffin throughout her first pregnancy and in the delivery room when she gave birth to her daughter, MaKayla, who is now 14.

‚ÄúThe minute I started going into labor, she started calling her friends,‚Äù Griffin said. ‚ÄúEveryone was looking for me and looking after me.‚Äù

Wilson-Griffin remembered her daughter‚Äôs gynecologist from the days when he was a resident at the hospital. At least 20 other people connected to Wilson-Griffin were in her daughter‚Äôs room, cheering her on and caring for her through her delivery.

Her presence would remain steadfast at soccer, basketball and field hockey games her granddaughters would play or violin recitals she found time to attend. Wilson-Griffin would take the girls and her grandson, T.J., on summer vacations that included a train ride to Chicago or caravan trips to the Deep South, where she would visit family.

Pray for Nana

In mid-March, as news of the novel coronavirus spread across the country and organizations started canceling large gatherings, Wilson-Griffin drove to Indianapolis to attend a professional nursing conference. Griffin fussed at her mom for deciding to go despite the risk.



Griffin said this conference needed to be her last for a while.

The next week, Wilson-Griffin was hospitalized with pneumonia, a condition she had experienced before because of her lupus.

Wilson-Griffin told her daughter she might be able to see her once she was cleared by doctors. Griffin told her mom to keep her posted. She asked her daughters to pray for their nana.

The next day, Griffin texted her mom but heard nothing. She would eventually learn her mother had been sedated because her breathing had become labored. Wilson-Griffin was diagnosed with the virus on a Wednesday. By Friday, her dear friend Lesser suited up in protective gear to see her and to report back to the family.

The family never got to tell her goodbye.

The virus had caused her organs and health functions to shut down. Wilson-Griffin died before doctors could remove her from a ventilator.

She was buried with her late husband in Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery in St. Louis.

Birthdays above

At midnight on what would‚Äôve been her 64th birthday, more than five weeks after Wilson-Griffin died, her granddaughters wished her a happy birthday in the family‚Äôs group text.

‚ÄúWe love and miss you already,‚Äù one text read. The other wished her fun in heaven.

The family gathered at Wilson-Griffin‚Äôs home later that day to release pillow-shaped balloons into the sky with messages for her eyes only.

A yellowish-gray substance wrapped in a chilled tortilla with a side of mashed strawberries and blueberries arrived around noon on Monday.

‚ÄúSurprise, Daddy! We brought you lunch,‚Äù said Matteo, my 2-year-old, beaming along with his older brother, Lucca, in the doorway to my makeshift home office.

My wife had given our children strict instructions not to disturb Daddy, and, mostly, they had complied. Sure, there were the occasional high-pitched shrieks and the wallop of what sounded like the armoire tipping over and slamming onto the ceiling above me ‚Äî not to mention the ‚ÄúOnt some waffles!‚Äù cry from Matteo every couple of hours or so.

But after heapings of coronavirus gloom from the morning news, my children‚Äôs scrambled egg offering brought more comfort than a plate of my favorite spaghetti carbonara.

I‚Äôve never worked from home before. I‚Äôm on Day 3 and can‚Äôt imagine this isolation lasting for another two, three, four ‚Äî goodness knows how many more weeks.

But we can‚Äôt really shut out the outside world. Beside the barrage of bad news ‚Äî including mounting coronavirus cases in Italy, my father‚Äôs home ‚Äî my wife and I worry that Matteo, who is asthmatic, might need a trip to the emergency room, as he has a dozen or so times since his birth. I‚Äôm not a particularly religious man, but I‚Äôve prayed about that in recent days.

But like everyone else, we are adjusting to this new reality.

I‚Äôm struck by how quiet it is in the mornings ‚Äî before my children awaken. Quiet enough to hear chattering sparrows and the bird song that cuts through all of that, the whit-choo, whit-choo, whit-choo! of the northern Cardinal. Signs, too, that spring is not so far off.

This morning, we were greeted by the smiling, bearded face of ‚ÄúMr. Muhammad,‚Äù Matteo‚Äôs Montessori music teacher, who could be seen on my phone strumming his guitar all alone in the school‚Äôs music room. Typically, he‚Äôs accompanied by a dozen or so bouncing toddlers, including Matteo. The day before, he‚Äôd offered a yoga class as a way to help all of us to calm down a little bit.

‚ÄúCan I listen to Mr. Hammad?‚Äù Matteo said, noticing the video on my phone.

Then, not fully grasping the reality of the situation, he said, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Matteo? Where‚Äôs Logan?‚Äù

Mr. Muhammad is nothing short of a rock star in our family ‚Äî a guy who will only become more revered as this thing drags on.

It‚Äôs been harder to gauge how Lucca, my 8-year-old, is doing. Not long ago, he declared, ‚ÄúChildren are dying from the coronavirus.‚Äù

He has stopped talking about the disease in recent days. And when I sat him down and asked if he‚Äôs still worried, he assured me that he isn‚Äôt.

But it‚Äôs hard to say what‚Äôs going on in that Pokemon-obsessed head of his. At times, he‚Äôs refused to sleep in the bunk bed he‚Äôd begged us for months to buy. The other day, I found him curled up asleep on the floor in his bedroom. And Lucca, like Matteo, is more insistent than ever that I read him a bedtime story every night.

On Tuesday, Lucca brought me ‚Äúlunch‚Äù ‚Äî two pieces of bread that appeared to have leaped out of the toaster in fear of being browned. Lucca had smeared peanut butter on one slice and made a strawberry jam smiley face on the other.

To cool the cabin fever, I announced we were going to have a backyard baseball game on my lunch break ‚Äî never mind that Dad, who grew up in England, doesn‚Äôt actually know the rules of baseball. About 10 minutes later, Matteo arrived at my office door in a shirt and, from the waist down, nothing but his birthday suit.

‚ÄúI want to go out and play baseball!‚Äù he shouted.

His mother, with one arched eyebrow, followed close behind holding a diaper and questioning the timing of my announcement.

‚ÄúDaddy shouldn‚Äôt have brought it up now,‚Äù she said.

So we are all adjusting. What choice do we have?

266,266,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/business/live-stock-market-coronavirus.html,The New York Times,08/04/2020,[],Wall Street Rallies as Investors Focus on the Recovery,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/08/business/08markets-briefing-WTO/oakImage-1586356511991-facebookJumbo.jpg,"
This briefing is no longer updating. Read the latest developments in the coronavirus outbreak here.
The S&P 500 is up 23 percent from its March low.Wall Street resumed its rally on Wednesday. With a more than 3 percent gain, the S&P 500 is now up about 23 percent from its March 23 low.
The market has been steadily climbing since it hit that bottom, a rebound that began after the Federal Reserve and lawmakers in Washington took steps to protect the U.S. economy from a collapse amid the coronavirus pandemic. Stocks are still down about 19 percent from their late February high.
More recently, the gains have reflected hope that the peak of the pandemic in many cities is near, or already past. The growth rate of hospitalizations in hot spots like New York is slowing; China has lifted its lockdown of Wuhan, the city where the virus emerged; and governments in parts of Europe are making plans to do the same.
To some extent, the recent gains also reflect Wall Street‚Äôs fear of missing out on the rebound that many analysts predicted would eventually come.
‚ÄúIf you wait until the coast is clear, you will have missed a huge part of the gains,‚Äù said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak a trading and asset management firm. ‚ÄúAnd professional investors can‚Äôt afford to do that.‚Äù
For now, though, it is big money managers ‚Äî not mom-and-pop retail investors ‚Äî who are in on the action. Hedge fund traders and mutual fund managers have swooped into the market, driving sharp gains for blue-chip shares that have been battered by the market sell-off.
Still, the market‚Äôs recent optimism is set against a grim backdrop of economic and human catastrophe that continues to play out ‚Äî and which threatens to undercut any rally at a moment‚Äôs notice.
In Europe, data released on Wednesday showed that Germany and France, the largest economies in the region, were heading toward their sharpest downturns since World War II.
There‚Äôs more data to come. A new report on weekly jobless claims on Thursday is certain to show millions more Americans are out of work. The two prior reports recorded more than 10 million claims for unemployment in late March.
Investors go shopping: ‚ÄúWe will never get these prices again.‚Äù
After a 3.4 percent rise on Wednesday, the S&P 500 has bounced 23 percent from its low in a disastrous March, despite a darkening outlook for economic growth and corporate profits.
One reason: It‚Äôs the time to buy for investors able to stomach the market‚Äôs swoons.Cole Smead, a portfolio manager at the Smead Value Fund, has been snapping up bargains in beaten-up parts of the market, like oil and energy producers, homebuilders and shopping-mall companies, that are closely tied to short-term swings in the economy.
‚ÄúWe will never get these prices again,‚Äù said Mr. Smead, whose fund has $1.3 billion in assets.As economically damaging as the pandemic will no doubt be, Wall Street is starting to see a path forward that wasn‚Äôt clear a few weeks ago. Slowing infection rates, hefty government relief packages and the Federal Reserve‚Äôs efforts to calm the markets have helped eased investors‚Äô minds.
Some of the buyers are opportunistic hedge fund traders and mutual fund managers, driving sharp gains for blue-chip shares that were battered by the market sell-off. Some are traders feeling pressure to get into a rising market. And some are short-sellers forced to buy to minimize their own losses.
But mom-and-pop investors have largely been sitting out ‚Äî a sign that the rally doesn‚Äôt reflect widespread optimism.
WeWork skips rent payments as it seeks to renegotiate better deals.
WeWork has not made scheduled rent payments to the landlords of some of the buildings where it operates its co-working spaces, according to a person briefed on the situation.
The decision to hold back rent is part of WeWork‚Äôs efforts to renegotiate better deals with building owners as the company tries to cut costs and limit its losses. WeWork‚Äôs executive chairman, Marcelo Claure, said in December that the company would try to get better terms from landlords, but the economic swoon caused by the coronavirus pandemic has made the task more urgent.
‚ÄúRather than implementing a company-wide policy on rent payments, we are individually reaching out to our more than 600 global landlord partners to work in good faith towards finding asset-specific solutions that benefit all parties involved,‚Äù WeWork said in a statement.
The person briefed on the situation said WeWork was seeking to renegotiate leases around the world, not just in the United States.
The Wall Street Journal first reported that WeWork was skipping rent payments.The virus outbreak has emptied many of WeWork‚Äôs locations and may reduce demand for its space over the longer terms. Seeing the empty spaces, landlords might be persuaded to reduce WeWork‚Äôs lease payments, but they also know that SoftBank, the company‚Äôs dominant shareholder, committed billions of dollars to finance WeWork‚Äôs expansion.
With hospitals in dire straits, insurance companies are speeding up payments.In a sign of just how desperate hospitals and doctors are for cash during the coronavirus pandemic, insurance companies, notorious for slow-walking their payments to health care providers, are now speeding up how quickly they pay.
‚ÄúThere was a universal cry for cash,‚Äù said Paul Markovich, the chief executive of Blue Shield of California, which said it would advance up to $200 million in payments to hospitals and doctors.
With revenues down for surgeries and other care not viewed as essential, providers are scrambling for money to pay for protective equipment and other supplies. ‚ÄúThe pressure on the entire health care ecosystem is something I‚Äôve never seen before,‚Äô‚Äò said Mr. Markovich, who hopes to get out the first payments as soon as this week.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre effectively advancing payment now and collecting later,‚Äù he said, even as it is also working with customers about letting them delay paying premiums.
UnitedHealth, which owns one of the nation‚Äôs largest insurance companies, said it would also take a series of steps, like waiving the need for pre-authorization when patients see a new doctor or go to a skilled nursing facility, that should result in nearly $2 billion in payments getting in the hands of providers more quickly. Providers could be paid in a matter of days rather than several weeks.
United also announced it would be making $125 million available in small-business loans to medical groups that work with its Optum unit, which provides consulting and other services.
Highmark, a Blue Cross plan in Pittsburgh, said it was advancing more than $30 million to primary care doctors, who have been particularly hard hit as many patients have decided to forgo face-to-face doctors‚Äô visits.
Another way to see the recession: Power usage is way down.New data on electricity use suggest that U.S. economic activity probably declined more over the past three weeks than it did during the entire year and a half of the Great Recession. It may already be the deepest downturn since the Great Depression; it is certainly the fastest.
These numbers are important because our official statistics cannot keep pace with the abrupt economic changes the coronavirus shutdown has caused. All those closed stores, silenced factories and darkened office buildings are yet to be counted in the government‚Äôs official economic numbers, which take months to collect, process and report.
But evidence of the sharp economic shift shows up in a large and rapid decline in electricity usage over recent weeks.
Food banks are squeezed by rising hunger and dwindling resources.
Demand for food assistance in the United States is surging, as millions of Americans find themselves out of work and school closures mean that many families who counted on them for free or subsidized meals need to turn elsewhere.
The rise in need is coming just as food banks face shortages of both donated food and volunteer workers.
It‚Äôs a nationwide phenomena:At Food Bank for the Heartland in Omaha, the amount of food donated for March dropped by nearly half. The food bank typically purchases $73,000 of food in a month this time of year but has spent $675,000 in the past four weeks.In Jonesboro, Ark., after a powerful tornado struck, a food bank received less than half the donations it expected because nervous families held on to what they had.In Washington State and Louisiana, the National Guard has been called in to help pack food boxes and ensure that the distributions run smoothly.Feeding America, the nation‚Äôs largest network of food banks, with more than 200 affiliates, has projected a $1.4 billion shortfall in the next six months alone.‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anything like it,‚Äù said Stacy Dean, vice president for food assistance policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization in Washington. She has studied food security for more than a quarter century. ‚ÄúPeople love the phrase ‚Äòthe perfect storm,‚Äô‚Äù she added, ‚Äúbut nothing is built for this.‚Äù
Europe‚Äôs biggest economies brace for the sharpest drop since World War II.
Europe‚Äôs pandemic-induced lockdowns were widely expected to throw the continent into a deep recession. Germany and France, the largest economies, said on Wednesday that they were headed toward their sharpest downturns since World War II, a warning that showed just how bad it‚Äôs about to get.
France officially slid into a recession after suffering one of the worst quarterly contractions in more than 50 years. Growth tumbled an estimated 6 percent from January to April, from the fourth quarter, the central bank said. For every two weeks the population remains under confinement, the economy shrinks by at least 1.5 percent, it added.
And Germany is sliding toward its deepest recession on record, with growth expected to plunge almost 10 percent from April through June, five leading economic institutes said Tuesday.
Here‚Äôs what you need to know about coronavirus relief for small business.The federal stimulus bills enacted in March, including a $2 trillion economic relief plan, offer help for the millions of American small businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic.
Cash grants. Low-interest loans. Payments to offset some payroll costs for businesses that keep or rehire workers. There are also enhancements to unemployment insurance and paid leave.
Here are the answers to common questions about these programs. If you have questions, or have applied for small business aid and can tell us how the process went, we‚Äôd love to hear from you.

Read the latest developments in the coronavirus outbreak here. The S&P 500 is up 23 percent from its March low.Wall Street resumed its rally on Wednesday. With a more than 3 percent gain, the S&P 500 is now up about 23 percent from its March 23 low. The market has been steadily climbing since it hit that bottom, a rebound that began after the Federal Reserve and lawmakers in Washington took steps to protect the U.S. economy from a collapse amid the coronavirus pandemic. Stocks are still down about 19 percent from their late February high. More recently, the gains have reflected hope that the peak of the pandemic in many cities is near, or already past. The growth rate of hospitalizations in hot spots like New York is slowing; China has lifted its lockdown of Wuhan, the city where the virus emerged; and governments in parts of Europe are making plans to do the same. To some extent, the recent gains also reflect Wall Street‚Äôs fear of missing out on the rebound that many analysts predicted would eventually come. ‚ÄúIf you wait until the coast is clear, you will have missed a huge part of the gains,‚Äù said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak a trading and asset management firm. ‚ÄúAnd professional investors can‚Äôt afford to do that.‚Äù For now, though, it is big money managers ‚Äî not mom-and-pop retail investors ‚Äî who are in on the action. Hedge fund traders and mutual fund managers have swooped into the market, driving sharp gains for blue-chip shares that have been battered by the market sell-off. Still, the market‚Äôs recent optimism is set against a grim backdrop of economic and human catastrophe that continues to play out ‚Äî and which threatens to undercut any rally at a moment‚Äôs notice. In Europe, data released on Wednesday showed that Germany and France, the largest economies in the region, were heading toward their sharpest downturns since World War II. There‚Äôs more data to come. A new report on weekly jobless claims on Thursday is certain to show millions more Americans are out of work. The two prior reports recorded more than 10 million claims for unemployment in late March. Investors go shopping: ‚ÄúWe will never get these prices again.‚Äù After a 3.4 percent rise on Wednesday, the S&P 500 has bounced 23 percent from its low in a disastrous March, despite a darkening outlook for economic growth and corporate profits. One reason: It‚Äôs the time to buy for investors able to stomach the market‚Äôs swoons.Cole Smead, a portfolio manager at the Smead Value Fund, has been snapping up bargains in beaten-up parts of the market, like oil and energy producers, homebuilders and shopping-mall companies, that are closely tied to short-term swings in the economy. ‚ÄúWe will never get these prices again,‚Äù said Mr. Smead, whose fund has $1.3 billion in assets.As economically damaging as the pandemic will no doubt be, Wall Street is starting to see a path forward that wasn‚Äôt clear a few weeks ago. Slowing infection rates, hefty government relief packages and the Federal Reserve‚Äôs efforts to calm the markets have helped eased investors‚Äô minds. Some of the buyers are opportunistic hedge fund traders and mutual fund managers, driving sharp gains for blue-chip shares that were battered by the market sell-off. Some are traders feeling pressure to get into a rising market. And some are short-sellers forced to buy to minimize their own losses. But mom-and-pop investors have largely been sitting out ‚Äî a sign that the rally doesn‚Äôt reflect widespread optimism. WeWork skips rent payments as it seeks to renegotiate better deals. WeWork has not made scheduled rent payments to the landlords of some of the buildings where it operates its co-working spaces, according to a person briefed on the situation. The decision to hold back rent is part of WeWork‚Äôs efforts to renegotiate better deals with building owners as the company tries to cut costs and limit its losses. WeWork‚Äôs executive chairman, Marcelo Claure, said in December that the company would try to get better terms from landlords, but the economic swoon caused by the coronavirus pandemic has made the task more urgent. ‚ÄúRather than implementing a company-wide policy on rent payments, we are individually reaching out to our more than 600 global landlord partners to work in good faith towards finding asset-specific solutions that benefit all parties involved,‚Äù WeWork said in a statement. The person briefed on the situation said WeWork was seeking to renegotiate leases around the world, not just in the United States. The Wall Street Journal first reported that WeWork was skipping rent payments.The virus outbreak has emptied many of WeWork‚Äôs locations and may reduce demand for its space over the longer terms. Seeing the empty spaces, landlords might be persuaded to reduce WeWork‚Äôs lease payments, but they also know that SoftBank, the company‚Äôs dominant shareholder, committed billions of dollars to finance WeWork‚Äôs expansion.

Since mid-March he‚Äôs been told his business, Tonsor Barbershop, 3935 N. Pulaski Rd., was non-essential and should be closed to limit the spread of COVID-19. Now, somehow, golf courses are more important?

‚ÄúI mean, the whole essential and non-essential thing bugs me because I‚Äôve seen people in the media and people in government with new haircuts,‚Äù Santa said. ‚ÄúWhy are their haircuts more important than that of grocery workers and nurses?‚Äù

On Tuesday, Gov. J.B. Pritzker unveiled a five-phased plan for reopening the state. It won‚Äôt be until the third phase ‚Äî called ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù ‚Äî that barbershops and salons will be able to reopen, with restrictions. A Chicago plan unveiled Friday by Mayor Lori Lightfoot has similar steps.

There isn‚Äôt a timetable for implementing Phase Three. It depends on how many COVID-19 patients are admitted to hospitals or need ICU beds; both numbers must be stable or declining.

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt make sense to me that we have to stay on the sideline,‚Äù Santa said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been trained in the highest levels of sanitation and sterilization.‚Äù

Most of his barbers wore gloves and masks before the pandemic forced his business to shutter, he said. It‚Äôs also an appointment-based shop, so he can limit how many people enter.

Barbers‚Äô sole income relies on breaking social-distancing rules, and unlike restaurants or retail stores, barbers can‚Äôt pivot to delivery or curbside pick-ups.

Santa doesn‚Äôt minimize the threat of COVID-19 and believes it‚Äôs important to flatten the curve. But the absence of support from the state and federal government has triggered a bit of desperation.

Santa has applied for about five different loans and grants since mid-March, including the Small Business Association‚Äôs Paycheck Protection Program.

He has yet to receive any assistance.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a taxpayer,‚Äù Santa said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm not receiving any help.‚Äù

Self-employed workers like barbers typically don‚Äôt qualify for unemployment benefits because they don‚Äôt pay into unemployment insurance, but they are eligible for the PPP program.

To be approved for that program, Santa first had to file for regular unemployment to confirm he was eligible for nothing ‚Äî which he did.

But he still can‚Äôt apply to the pandemic unemployment program until the portal opens on May 11 ‚Äî almost two months after the first stay-at-home order was issued.

He‚Äôs hoping to get aid quickly so he can pay his May rent.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty stressful because I thought by now, I would‚Äôve gotten some help.‚Äù Santa said.

Damon Dorsey, president of the American Barber Association, said COVID-19 hit barbershops across the country like a ‚Äútsunami.‚Äù It‚Äôs an industry filled with small neighborhood shops, and the lack of government help has created a level of anxiety never seen before, he said.

He would like to see shops open but under strict guidelines, such as appointment-based services only; mandatory masks and gloves for barbers and clients; and constant sanitization of shops.

‚ÄúIt would be great to have programs in place that could help barbers, but barbers aren‚Äôt seeing any of these benefits that are out there,‚Äù Dorsey said. ‚ÄúFor example, none of our members received any support from the [Paycheck Protection Program].‚Äù

Dorsey said the loss of revenue have driven many barbers into the shadows and defying state orders.

Chris Turcios, owner of Headquarters Barber Studio, 3040 W. Irving Park Road, said he‚Äôs cut hair secretly since the stay-at-home order was issued. Some of those clandestine haircuts were police officers.

‚ÄúI barely just got my stimulus check yesterday,‚Äù Turcios said Friday. ‚ÄúWe are taking risks by doing these appointments, but I‚Äôm about to be three months behind on rent and have $2,000 in other bills.

‚ÄúWhat else am I supposed to do?‚Äù

Turcios, who also has applied for government assistance, said he is now relying on crowdsourced funding to support him and his staff. He recently asked his 1,700 friends on Facebook to donate just $2.

Despite the uncertainty, Turcios has created a plan for when he is allowed to reopen. This includes moving barber stations farther away from each other, removing their waiting area and allowing only 10 people into the shop at a time.

‚ÄúThis is a scary moment, scary that I might have to close,‚Äù Turcios said. ‚ÄúMan, we just want to be able to provide for our families.‚Äù

Some of those clandestine haircuts were police officers.  ‚ÄúI barely just got my stimulus check yesterday,‚Äù Turcios said Friday. ‚ÄúWe are taking risks by doing these appointments, but I‚Äôm about to be three months behind on rent and have $2,000 in other bills.  ‚ÄúWhat else am I supposed to do?‚Äù  Turcios, who also has applied for government assistance, said he is now relying on crowdsourced funding to support him and his staff. He recently asked his 1,700 friends on Facebook to donate just $2.  Despite the uncertainty, Turcios has created a plan for when he is allowed to reopen. This includes moving barber stations farther away from each other, removing their waiting area and allowing only 10 people into the shop at a time.  ‚ÄúThis is a scary moment, scary that I might have to close,‚Äù Turcios said. ‚ÄúMan, we just want to be able to provide for our families.‚Äù  Manny Ramos is a corps member in Report for America, a not-for-profit journalism program that aims to bolster Sun-Times coverage of issues affecting Chicago‚Äôs South and West sides."

Oddsmakers and statisticians from Sports Betting Dime have run projections of the likelihood that a fan would be infected by an asymptomatic carrier of COVID-19 while attending a sporting event. The projections are broken down by city, and factor in each city‚Äôs projected COVID-19 peak date ‚Äî for Illinois that is April 17 ‚Äî along with various presumptive league start dates.

They looked at nine cities, including Chicago, that have MLB, NBA and NHL franchises and how the probability of infection would change based on different league dates of June 1, June 15 or July 1.

The study assumes continued social distancing measures throughout the summer and further assumes standard game behavior by fans and uses the average crowd size from the previous season for each venue.

The numbers were similar among the three leagues, but they don‚Äôt look encouraging for sports fans looking to get back into a stadium anytime soon.

If Major League Baseball opens on June 1 at Wrigley Field (assuming an average attendance of 38,208), 818 people ‚Äî or 2.16% ‚Äî would be infected with the coronavirus. With a June 15 start date, that number drops to 204 infections (0.54%), but if MLB were to begin on July 1, there would be 92 people infections (0.24%).

If the NBA or NHL restarted at the United Center with an average attendance of 18,804, there would be 395 people infected (2.12%) with a June 1 restart date. If they begin on June 15, 99 people would be infected (0.53%) and July 1 would yield 44 infections (0.24%).

Nationwide the numbers vary according to the projected peak date of the virus. The projections put Chicago on the lower end of infection rates, with an 88% drop from 2.16% to 0.24% probability of infection if the start date is pushed back from June 1 to July 1. Boston and New York have a projected peak date one day sooner than Chicago on April 16. Their infection rate starts at roughly 0.54% for June 1 and drops to 0.05% on July 1. Miami doesn‚Äôt peak until May 2 and therefore their infection rate at an NBA or NHL game is 29.17% for a June 1 start, dropping to 13.82% with start on July 1.

Even with the later July 1 start date and a relatively low infection rate projected for Chicago, the exponentially increasing nature of the virus still means that each newly infected person will contribute to a swift inflation of the curve.

You may qualify for paid leave

Justin Paget

Qualified workers, including those telecommuting, can get two weeks of paid leave at full pay courtesy of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. Valid reasons include being unable to work because you are under quarantine order, have coronavirus symptoms and are seeking diagnosis, or must care for a child whose school or daycare provider is shut. If you're caring for a sick family member, you might still qualify for a portion of your pay.

Help with utility bills

Andrew Aitchison

Many utility companies ‚Äî including PG&E, Con Edison, American Electric Power Company and Duke Energy, among others ‚Äî have suspended service disconnections. You may be able to set up a payment plan for your utility bill or have some fees waived, such as for late payments. Check the website of your provider for assistance tapping into other support programs, such as Housing and Urban Development's Covid-19 resources. Your state's website may help. Some are stopping utility companies from shutting off services.

Sign up for insurance

If you lost your job and need health insurance, some states are holding special ACA open enrollments. AARP keeps an updated list of extensions on state health exchanges.

Uninsured people in Washington, D.C., Maryland, New York and Vermont can enroll for health insurance through their state exchanges through June 15. California is allowing state residents to enroll through June 30. Find out if you qualify for Medicaid by inputting your state, family size and income level on the Healthcare.gov calculator.

Rent relief

The CARES Act has aid for homeowners who are struggling with their federally backed mortgage payments but renters also have some help. Many states and cities have put a stop order on evictions. New York, for instance, has a 90-day eviction ban. A Columbia Law School professor frequently updates this list of state actions.

Penney, one of America's most recognizable clothing stores, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy late Friday. In doing so, the 118-year-old store became the latest major retailer to succumb to a sales slump during the coronavirus pandemic.

J.C. Penney was one of many brick-and-mortar stores forced to temporarily close its locations as the pandemic spread across the U.S. The closures put J.C. Penney a step closer to bankruptcy, the company said Friday.

CEO Jill Soltau said in a statement Friday that J.C. Penney's leadership made significant progress toward rebuilding the company, but ""the closure of our stores due to the pandemic necessitated a more fulsome review to include the elimination of outstanding debt.""

J.C. Penney officials said its physical and online stores will remain open during the bankruptcy restructuring. The company has already begun reopening some locations, including in Arizona, Florida, Georgia and Texas. The Plano-based clothing store filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. Southern District of Texas.

Although the pandemic further dented J.C. Penney, the store has been declining for years amid the growth in e-commerce, and is weighed down by $4 billion in debt. It has closed numerous stores in recent years to cut costs.

J.C. Penney has $500 million in cash and has commitments from lenders for another $900 million to help the company get through its structuring, company officials said. J.C. Penney plans to close more stores as part of the bankruptcy, but company officials didn't specify which ones or how many.

Soltau said bankruptcy ""is the best path to ensure that JCPenney will build on its over 100-year history to serve our customers for decades to come.""

J.C. Penney, which has roughly 85,000 employees, has now joined Neiman Marcus and J. Crew among the retailers to go bankrupt since the virus struck. In its most recent quarter J.C. Penney's sales fell nearly 8%, to $3.4 billion, from the year-ago period, while income was $27 million, down from $75 million a year ago. J.C. Penney missed two debt payments in April and May, which many analysts saw as a harbinger of bankruptcy.

""J.C. Penney actually embraced e-commerce earlier than most other U.S. department store chains, but the company did not capitalize on this head start,"" Bob Hoyler, senior research analyst at Euromonitor International, said in a statement to CBS News. ""J.C. Penney has not been able to survive on its e-commerce sales alone during the pandemic, so the forced store closures represent months of revenue that will simply never be recouped.""

The company's bankruptcy comes days after J.C. Penney gave its top executives millions of dollars in bonus pay. CEO Jill Soltau received $4.5 million, while chief financial officer Bill Wafford, chief merchant officer Michelle Wlazlo and chief human resources officer Brynn Evanson each got $1 million, the company disclosed in a May 10 regulatory filing.

Large companies give so-called retention bonuses to top executives to encourage corporate leaders to remain on board as the company restructures and, if possible, exit court supervision as stronger competitors.

1. Which investments would you call under-the-radar opportunities right now?

Many investors, whether they are pension funds or retirees, need income.

And bonds, which used to be the cornerstone of an income-generating portfolio, just aren't delivering unless you venture out on the risk spectrum.

One can generate a much higher level of income today from a portfolio on high-quality dividend paying stocks. And unlike bond coupons, dividends from stocks can grow over time.

2. What is your most contrarian, or surprising, market call in this environment?

We are seeing pressure on companies to halt buybacks and dividend payments, and some will be forced to do just that, especially if they benefit from government assistance.

But dividends are an important part of thoughtful capital allocation. If a company has excess cash that it has no place to invest for a return above its cost of capital, it's prudent to return that capital to shareholders. Otherwise, they are destroying value.

Our view is that well-managed companies will not abandon sound capital allocation policies. While they may temporarily suspend buybacks, those with strong balance sheets and ongoing cash flows will continue paying dividends.

3. Name one stock or investment you're most bullish on right now.

Our approach is not to find some rare gem with undiscovered value. We look for a diversified group of stocks where we have a high degree of confidence they will pay and grow dividends.

Here's one of them: Watsco, the largest distributor of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies in North America. It has a history of returning cash to shareholders, having paid a quarterly dividend since 2009.

They are also making significant investments in technology. A lot of companies are talking about ecommerce and mobile apps; however, most investors don't associate technology with HVAC equipment distributors.

4. What is one risk within the market you feel investors are missing?

In a time like this, active management is essential for an income-oriented equity portfolio.

Companies that have been buying back shares and paying dividends while piling up debt are in for a rough period. For a portfolio to provide sustained income, companies need to be vetted for the ability to pay dividends that are covered by sustainable and growing cash flows, and for shareholder-friendly management.",Left-center,USA,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"10 big money managers shared with us their favorite hidden gems in the market, and the contrarian trades they're making amid the pandemic","Kera Van Valen, senior research analyst and portfolio manager of Epoch Investment Partners' equity shareholder yield strategies: ""While they may temporarily suspend buybacks, [companies] with strong balance sheets and ongoing cash flows will continue paying dividends.""

If you‚Äôre concerned your children are falling behind with remote learning, don‚Äôt worry! I‚Äôm here to pass on some virtually valuable lessons I‚Äôve learned from my kid‚Äôs Zoom class, one room over:

When in doubt, mute yourself.

Sock puppets are an excellent way to make your point.

Try at least to wear pants.

If you can‚Äôt think of anything to say, just try, ‚ÄúThank you for sharing.‚Äù

Good lighting is key, even if you have the complexion of a 5-year-old.

Waiting to be called on, patiently, with your hand in the air, can suck your soul.

Sucking your thumb while others talk counts as a legitimate listening face.

Showing up to Morning Meeting with your hair French-braided and accessorized with a bow is a bit too extra for a pandemic.

Someone who teaches ""mindfulness"" is too in the moment to remember her students‚Äô names.

Making the most of quarantine:From robots to 3D printing, how coronavirus can inspire waves of innovation

When you finally get called on, and you can‚Äôt remember anymore what you were going to say, just talk about anything Harry Potter or how your mom doesn‚Äôt want you staring at a screen all day.

During Morning Weather Report, try not to complain that the weather at your Cape Cod beach house is chillier than the weather being experienced by your friends whose parents are essential workers.

Indoor tepees full of stuffed animals make excellent ‚Äúdesignated work spaces.‚Äù

It is good for lessons to be interrupted by pets and cute siblings.

Using jellybeans to solve ‚Äúnumber stories‚Äù is very effective, particularly when it comes to eating them for subtraction problems.

When it comes to expressing yourself during virtual arts and crafts time, it is helpful to chant while squeezing glue, ‚ÄúDot, dot, not a lot.‚Äù

When discussing wants and needs, remember that trampolines and unicorns, as necessary as they seem, qualify as ‚Äúwants.‚Äù

How to get teens to heed the warnings:Why are young people so bad at coronavirus social distancing? Blame their brains.

Nobody needs to hear that your dad farted during dinner last night.

Nobody needs to see your mom in her jog bra behind you during Word Work.

People who keep interrupting end up in the Waiting Room.

You don‚Äôt have to announce to everyone that you need to go to the bathroom.

You don‚Äôt have to take your Zoom meeting with you to the bathroom.

‚ÄúNamaste‚Äù is a nice way to greet your friends.

Don‚Äôt pretend you have a question when it‚Äôs really a comment ‚Äî you won‚Äôt fool anyone.

You don‚Äôt have to announce to everyone that you‚Äôve returned from the bathroom.

If you are sheltering at your country house in the Hamptons, ask your essential gardener to turn off the leaf blower during Story Time.

Gretchen Whitmer‚Äôs announcement Monday of a partial reopening of those regions starting Friday.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm very confident,‚Äù said Amanda Danielson, a co-owner of Italian restaurant Trattoria Stella in Traverse City. ‚ÄúWe put all of our safety protocols in place as if we were receiving guests knowing that eventuality. We feel very prepared to be able to do so in a safe manner.‚Äù

Traverse City is located in one of 17 northern Michigan counties that ‚Äî along with the entire Upper Peninsula ‚Äî will see lessened restrictions on Friday.

Whitmer‚Äôs plan reopens retail businesses and offices as well as bars and restaurants operating at 50% capacity. Employees must be trained on safety protocols.

‚ÄúObviously our biggest concern is the safety of our staff,‚Äù Danielson said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not a hotspot up here. We‚Äôve had every few cases relatively speaking, which why we‚Äôre able to reopen, but at the same time the people that come here are from high-infected areas‚Ä¶ Stella will look a little different until the scare of the virus is gone.‚Äù

Danielson said they‚Äôve shifted the floor plan of the restaurant and cordoned off seating. Seating will only be available through reservations.

The relaxed rules represent a major step for restaurants, said Justin Winslow, president and CEO of the Michigan Restaurant & Lodging Association. The organization recently provided restaurateurs a roadmap to reopening that addresses sanitation, customer health and social distancing.

‚ÄúWhat happens in these two regions is going to help set the stage for what we hope is a quick reopening for the rest of the state‚Ä¶‚Äù Winslow said. ‚ÄúEven if you‚Äôre not in one of those two regions, it‚Äôs a sign of hope. It‚Äôs a tangible specific date certain that we know a restaurant will have the opportunity to demonstrate that they can operate safely.""

In Sault Ste. Marie, Laurie Jarvie of gift shop Field and Forage said she‚Äôs excited to open her doors to customers again. She‚Äôs been operating her business through online sales, delivery and curbside pickups.

Jarvie said she was surprised by the governor‚Äôs decision for a partial reopening. She notes the low number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Chippewa County which includes Sault Ste. Marie. Since its last report last week there were seven confirmed cases in the county.

‚ÄúI feel like the rest of the state really got punished because of the way things were downstate‚Ä¶‚Äù Jarvie said.

Jeff Bladzik, co-owner of the Painted Lady Saloon in Manistee, will continue to run the dining portion of the business as carryout only and allow drinkers at the bar.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been doing to-go through this whole thing and we just feel it will add a lot of chaos to us if we‚Äôre trying to do in-house,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf the amount of takeout stays at the level it is, we won‚Äôt be able to handle it both ways because of the limited space we have in our kitchen.""

Warren Call, president and CEO of Traverse Connect, which merged with the Traverse City Area Chamber of Commerce in 2019, said his organization has advocated for the phased reopening announced by Whitmer on Monday because nearly half of his area's employees are in the hospitality and healthcare sectors.

""It's only a handful of industries, but it's an important step in the process,"" he said. ""It's always amazing how flexible entrepreneurs are. We've seen great pivots for businesses adding curbside, take out, catering and now they can add to that partial re-openings that will only help them get enough cash flow to make it work. We're making sure every sector is prepared when they get their shot.""

Rich Studley, president and CEO of the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, said the phased re-opening is ""long overdue"" and ""should have happened weeks ago.""

""It's been clear the COVID outbreak is subsiding in Michigan,"" he said. ""There's a lot of good people in the (Whitmer) administration, but there's not a lot of people in the administration who have ever owned and operated a business.""

Studley said the next few weeks will be critical for seasonal businesses.

""This is when you have soft openings,"" he said. ""This is when they stock the shelves. This is when they do trainings. If you're a hospitality business in the U.P. and you're not open by Memorial Day ... in many cases, they only have June, July and August to earn the revenue need for the year.""

Bill Golden, co-president of Golden Shoes on Traverse City's Front Street, said his business has been down 96% since he started doing curbside orders only on March 20. He's been planning for the day when his business was cleared to reopen.

""I have all my (personal protective equipment),"" he said. ""Masks, gloves. Two weeks ago I had the carpets cleaned. I said I want to be ready when it's time to go.

""The only thing I don't have is signs for distancing and I pick those up tomorrow,"" Golden continued. ""I have my thermometer. Every one of my employees is going to have their temperature taken when they come through the door.""

Tina Schuett, owner of the Rare Bird Brewpub in Traverse City, is not ready to re-open right away.

""We're not going to open until the 28th just to make sure we're keeping our staff and patrons safe,"" she said. ""We kind of want to let the first wave pass by and then we'll jump in.""

Schuett is also worried about a potential influx of out-of-towners from areas of the state that will still be closed.

""The scariest thing to us is the fact that people from downstate, in the higher-risk zones, are going to be coming up here now,"" she said. ""It seems like a guarantee that we will see an increase in cases up here when it happens.""

Hours later, Tesla‚Äôs attorneys filed suit in US District Court in the Northern District of California seeking an injunction against the county‚Äôs shelter-in-place order, because it ‚Äúcontradicts the Governor‚Äôs Order to the extent it restricts the operation of business operating in the federal critical infrastructure sectors.‚Äù

‚ÄúTesla is filing a lawsuit against Alameda County immediately,‚Äù Musk said on Twitter. ‚ÄúThe unelected & ignorant ‚Äòinterim Health Officer‚Äô of Alameda is acting contrary to the Governor, the President, our Constitutional freedoms & just plain common sense!‚Äù

Musk has been a vocal critic of coronavirus shelter-in-place orders, saying at the company‚Äôs April 29th earnings call that such restrictions were ‚Äúfascist‚Äù and not democratic. ‚ÄúWe are a bit worried about not being able to resume production in the Bay Area, and that should be identified as a serious risk,‚Äù Musk said. He also urged supporters on Twitter to ‚Äúplease voice your disagreement as strongly as possible with Alameda County.‚Äù

An Alameda County spokesperson said in a statement to The Verge on Saturday that the county Health Care Services Agency and Public Health Department have been ‚Äúcommunicating directly and working closely with the Tesla team on the ground in Fremont. This has been a collaborative, good faith effort to develop and implement a safety plan that allows for reopening while protecting the health and well-being of the thousands of employees who travel to and from work at Tesla‚Äôs factory.‚Äù

The spokesperson added that the team at Tesla had been responsive to guidance and recommendations ‚Äúand we look forward to coming to an agreement on an appropriate safety plan very soon.‚Äù The statement, issued several hours after Musk‚Äôs tweets, did not reference the Tesla CEO‚Äôs comments or mention him by name.

Frankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA. ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 9, 2020

‚ÄúWe appreciate that our residents and businesses have made tremendous sacrifices and that together we have been able to save lives and protect community health in our region,‚Äú the statement continues. ‚ÄúIt is our collective responsibility to move through the phases of reopening and loosening the restrictions of the Shelter-in-Place Order in the safest way possible, guided by data and science.‚Äù

Tesla announced plans to resume ‚Äúlimited operations‚Äù at its Fremont facility yesterday, which would bring back about 30 percent of its workforce. But officials in Alameda County, where Fremont is located, said yesterday that it was still under a shelter-in-place order and that Tesla it didn‚Äôt meet its criteria to reopen. ‚ÄúWe have not said that it‚Äôs appropriate to move forward,‚Äù said Erica Pan, Alameda County‚Äôs health officer, according to Bloomberg.

California Governor Gavin Newsom said Thursday that state-level guidance allowing manufacturing to resume some production didn‚Äôt supersede county-level restrictions. The company had unsucessfully tried to argue that Tesla‚Äôs production should be considered critical infrastructure.

The Fremont plant, where Tesla assembles its Model 3, Model S, Model X, and Model Y vehicles, was temporarily closed March 23rd to comply with the shelter-in-place order. Tesla reduced pay for all its US salaried employees as of April 13th and put most hourly workers who can‚Äôt work remotely on unpaid furlough. What would happen to the roughly 10,000 workers at the Fremont plant if Tesla were to move operations out of state as Musk tweeted, was unclear.

Both Tesla and Musk settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2018 over Musk‚Äôs tweets about taking Tesla private. Then, in 2019, the terms of the settlement were renegotiated. Under the new terms, a company lawyer must approve Musk‚Äôs tweets about certain parts of Tesla‚Äôs business before Musk sends them. That includes any announcement that would trigger a filing of the form 8-K, which is used for announcing unscheduled material events, to the SEC. As of this writing, Tesla has not filed an 8-K about Musk‚Äôs proposed factory move.

Tesla did not reply to a request for comment.

But dozens of workers had to report to the company‚Äôs automotive factory to finish processing the final batches of cars this week, according to an email to some of those workers obtained by The Verge and the account of one of the factory‚Äôs employees.

This comes as Tesla confirmed the first two cases of COVID-19 among its office workforce on Thursday, according to another email that was viewed by The Verge after it was first reported by Business Insider and Electrek. Tesla is also making its first workforce cuts during the pandemic, temporarily laying off some employees in Norway, an electric vehicle stronghold.

The email to factory employees, sent ahead of the production shutdown, informed some of these ‚Äúend of line‚Äù workers that they‚Äôd have to keep reporting to the automotive plant to run quality checks, make fixes, and charge and prep the cars for delivery. Tesla management, they were told, essentially wanted all departments that work on a car after it comes off the production line to keep reporting to the factory until the cars were out for delivery. The current employee, who was granted anonymity because they feared retribution, confirmed many of these workers reported to the factory throughout this week.

The local police department says Tesla is complying with the shelter-in-place order

A spokesperson for the local police department told The Verge that it ‚Äúconducted a visit and inspected Tesla [on Wednesday] and found their current level of operation to be in compliance‚Äù with the shelter-in-place order. ‚ÄúTheir vehicle assembly line has stopped and they have only a small number of employees in the factory. They have also gone to great lengths to implement social distancing measures,‚Äù they said.

Factory workers were also told in the email that they wouldn‚Äôt receive the paid leave Tesla has promised until their own departments finally shut down. Any workers who did not feel well or felt uncomfortable coming to work were encouraged to use accrued paid time off or take unpaid leave, which was the company‚Äôs guidance before the shutdown was announced last week.

The current factory worker said Tesla‚Äôs end of line process usually takes a few hours for a car with ‚Äúmoderate issues.‚Äù But they also said the company finished production on Monday with an increased number of cars considered to be ‚Äúwork in progress,‚Äù which, therefore, required more end of line work.

Cars coming off the production lines of legacy automakers usually complete end of line checks in a matter of minutes, according to Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst at Navigant Research. Tesla did not respond to questions about the end of line workers or the employees who tested positive for COVID-19.

Tesla had kept the Fremont, California factory open last week, even after the shelter-in-place order took effect in the San Francisco Bay Area on March 17th. The company had just started delivering the Model Y, its fifth electric car, and was in the middle of a typical end-of-quarter push to make and deliver as many cars as possible.

Tesla had just started delivering the Model Y as the pandemic gripped the US

At the same time that CEO Elon Musk was underplaying the threat of the coronavirus, almost every other major automaker suspended production operations in the United States following a deal between Ford, General Motors, Fiat Chrysler, and the United Auto Workers union. Tesla, which is the biggest automaker in the US without a unionized workforce, did tell some of its white-collar workers to work remotely if possible last week while the factory remained open.

The company ultimately announced on March 19th that it would comply with the Bay Area order and shut down operations at the California factory where the Model 3, Model S, Model X, and now the Model Y are assembled, and it agreed to reduce the workforce there to ‚Äúbasic operations‚Äù like processing payroll. Tesla announced that same day that it would also pause operations at its solar panel factory in New York, but that the Gigafactory in Nevada would keep operating, despite the governor asking all nonessential businesses to close.

It‚Äôs currently unclear which office the two infected Tesla employees work in. Laurie Shelby, who runs Tesla‚Äôs environmental, health, and safety division, said in the email that the two employees ‚Äúhad been working from home for nearly two weeks‚Äù before they tested positive for COVID-19. Shelby said the employees did not show symptoms of the disease while they were in the office and that their ‚Äúdirect coworkers, who were already working from home for nearly two weeks as well, were immediately notified so they can quarantine and watch for symptoms.‚Äù Both employees are ‚Äúquarantined at home and recovering well,‚Äù Shelby wrote.

Tesla briefly shut down its newest factory in China earlier this year as part of a government-mandated effort to suppress the spread of the virus. But Musk tweeted on Wednesday that he plans to reopen the New York factory ‚Äúas soon as humanly possible‚Äù as Tesla joins in the effort to help increase the production of ventilators, which are crucial to treating the worst symptoms of COVID-19.",Left-center,USA,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Some Tesla factory employees still had to work after the production shutdown,"Local officials have confirmed that Tesla stopped making electric cars in California on Monday, March 23rd, in compliance with a shelter-in-place order brought on by the novel coronavirus pandemic.

Shelby said the employees did not show symptoms of the disease while they were in the office and that their ‚Äúdirect coworkers, who were already working from home for nearly two weeks as well, were immediately notified so they can quarantine and watch for symptoms.‚Äù Both employees are ‚Äúquarantined at home and recovering well,‚Äù Shelby wrote.  Tesla briefly shut down its newest factory in China earlier this year as part of a government-mandated effort to suppress the spread of the virus. But Musk tweeted on Wednesday that he plans to reopen the New York factory ‚Äúas soon as humanly possible‚Äù as Tesla joins in the effort to help increase the production of ventilators, which are crucial to treating the worst symptoms of COVID-19."

LONDON ‚Äî When Boris Johnson was campaigning for Britain to leave the European Union in 2016 ‚Äî a path that many experts warned would end in disaster for the country ‚Äî one of his close allies, Michael Gove, famously declared that ‚Äúpeople in this country have had enough of experts.‚Äù
Now, Mr. Gove and Mr. Johnson are leading the British government as it confronts the calamity of the coronavirus, and Mr. Johnson, now the prime minister, insists the process is being guided by experts. The trouble is, those experts can often disagree with each other or change their minds about the right course of action.
That messy back-and-forth has been on vivid display this week with the publication of a startling new report on the virus from a team at Imperial College in London. The report, which warned that an uncontrolled spread of the disease could cause as many as 510,000 deaths in Britain, triggered a sudden shift in the government‚Äôs comparatively relaxed response to the virus.
American officials said the report, which projected up to 2.2 million deaths in the United States from such a spread, also influenced the White House to strengthen its measures to isolate members of the public.
Imperial College has advised the government on its response to previous epidemics, including SARS, avian flu and swine flu. With ties to the World Health Organization and a team of 50 scientists, led by a prominent epidemiologist, Neil Ferguson, Imperial is treated as a sort of gold standard, its mathematical models feeding directly into government policies.
But outside experts pointed out that the report‚Äôs alarming conclusions ‚Äî that the virus would overwhelm hospitals and that governments had no choice but to impose radical lockdown policies ‚Äî had been made in previous reports on coronavirus or on social media sites devoted to the outbreak.
‚ÄúA lot of it is not what they say, but who says it,‚Äù said Devi Sridhar, director of the global health governance program at Edinburgh University. ‚ÄúNeil Ferguson has a huge amount of influence.‚Äù
Imperial College, experts noted, was part of the advisory group for the government‚Äôs now-abandoned strategy, which played down radical social distancing and accepted that the infection would spread through the population. The theory is that this would build up so-called ‚Äúherd immunity,‚Äù so that the public would be more resistant in the face of a second wave of infections next winter.
But such a strategy, the report noted, would lead to a flood of critically ill patients in a country without enough beds. Instead, it said, Britain needs to pursue ‚Äúsuppression,‚Äù which involves far stricter lockdowns, like the closing of schools and the quarantine of infected people and their families. That would drive down the number of cases and spread out the flow of patients over a longer period, allowing hospitals to cope.
Dr. Ferguson has been candid that the report reached new conclusions because of the latest data from Italy, which has seen a spiraling rate of infections, swamping hospitals and forcing doctors to make agonizing decisions about who to treat.
‚ÄúThe U.K. has struggled in the past few weeks in thinking about how to handle this outbreak long term,‚Äù Dr. Ferguson said in an interview on Monday, just after the report was released. ‚ÄúBased on our estimates and other teams‚Äô, there‚Äôs really no option but follow in China‚Äôs footsteps and suppress.‚Äù
The report added, ‚Äúthis conclusion has only been reached in the last few days, with the refinement of estimates of likely ICU demand due to COVID-19 based on experience in Italy and the UK.‚Äù
But other experts said the burden on hospitals was clear as far back as the original outbreak in Wuhan, China. Lancet, the British medical journal, published an article in January, based on studying a small group of patients, which found that a third of people had to be admitted to intensive care units.
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help but feel angry that it has taken almost two months for politicians and even ‚Äòexperts‚Äô to understand the scale of the danger from SARS-CoV-2,‚Äù said Richard Horton, the editor-in-chief of Lancet, on Twitter. ‚ÄúThose dangers were clear from the very beginning.‚Äù
Some said governments should treat the report‚Äôs projections about suppression policies with the same caution. It says social distancing measures might have to be imposed for 18 months or more, at least intermittently, until a vaccine is developed and tested. But the report acknowledges this is uncertain, given the possibility of drug treatments and the mystery of how the virus is transmitted.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all using the 1918 pandemic flu handbook,‚Äù Dr. Sridhar said. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre in a different position than in 1918. We‚Äôre in 2020.‚Äù
After days of confusion about the wisdom of encouraging ‚Äúherd immunity,‚Äù the government sought to play down the dispute, arguing that this was not a deliberate part of its strategy but a byproduct of it. But it shifted to a policy of urging people not to go to pubs, restaurants, theaters or museums.
On Tuesday, the government‚Äôs chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said he expected these new, more stringent restrictions to last for months ‚Äî and that the authorities would have to monitor very carefully what would happen when they are eventually lifted.
British officials recognize that their health service faces a moment of truth. All non-urgent operations in England will be postponed for at least three months, starting April 15, to free up 30,000 beds to help tackle the coronavirus.
Britain lags behind other European nations in its supply of ventilators. Plans are underway to ramp up their numbers from over 8,000 to 12,000, though officials are reluctant to promise that even this is sufficient.
Underscoring the change in tone, Britain‚Äôs finance chief, Rishi Sunak, announced a gargantuan fiscal stimulus to salvage reeling British businesses and to try to stem job losses. The package, worth ¬£330 billion, or $422 billion, will include government-backed loans and tax breaks for companies and a three-month break in mortgage repayments for strapped homeowners.
‚ÄúWe have never in peacetime faced an economic fight like this,‚Äù said Mr. Sunak, who also promised support for airports and airlines in the coming days, after Britons were advised against all non-essential travel.
Mr. Johnson hinted on Tuesday that schools could be closed soon. But he still faces criticism for a lack of clarity, including his decision to urge people to avoid pubs and restaurants but not to order their closing. In fact, the government now intends to relax laws to allow pubs to stay open and produce takeout food.

‚ÄúAre you here for the haircut?‚Äô‚Äô she asked.

He was, and so Harris, wearing an N95 face mask, handed sanitary wipes to the man, and led him to the makeshift barber's chairin the living room.

Soft music played in the background as a breeze kicked up and wind chimes jingled. The smell of citrus-scented candles and incense co-mingled as the customer, John Batinovich of Hollywood, settled into the barber's chair.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a great set up here,‚Äô‚Äô he said.

It‚Äôs also illegal ‚Äî and during the coronavirus pandemic, the hair industry is drawing legal scrutiny across the country.

In Texas, Shelley Luther was arrested after she defied an order to close her salon during the COVID-19 outbreak. She spent two days in jail and was fined $7,000.

In Michigan, Karl Manke's professional and business licenses were suspended after he refused to close his barbershop. Manke, 77, was charged with two criminal misdemeanors for defying the governor‚Äôs stay-at-home orders.

In California, the state has threatened disciplinary action against open salons and said it is investigating 651 related complaints. The city of Los Angeles has filed criminal complaints against four hair salons and one barbershop ‚Äî along with 55 other businesses ‚Äî that were open in violation of the city‚Äôs Safer at Home orders, Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer said last week.

Also last week, the Ulster County Department of Health and Mental Health in New York announced that a barber had tested positive for COVID-19 after cutting hair after the state put shutdown orders in place.

The number of hairstylists setting up shop at home or coloring and cutting hair at customers‚Äô homes is on the rise as stay-at-home orders in states like California have stretched beyond eight weeks, more than a dozen hair stylists and industry experts told USA TODAY.

Financial pressure is cited as the chief reason hairstylists like Harris of Compton, California have put their cosmetology licenses at risk. Two weeks ago, Harris decided she had little choice.

‚ÄúDo I take a chance and get turned into a criminal because I decided to work and pay my bills on time?‚Äô‚Äô said Harris, 38. ‚ÄúOr do I just sit and watch my bills pile up, so when the economy does open up I‚Äôm thousands and thousands of dollars in debt?‚Äô‚Äô

There is no legal ambiguity in the state.

""California law requires that all services be performed in a licensed establishment,‚Äô‚Äô Cheri Gyuro, public information officer for the California Department of Consumer Affairs, told USA TODAY. Similar laws are in effect in every other state, said Steve Sleeper, executive director of the Professional Beauty Association.

But the hairstylists and barbers are fighting to regain legal work opportunities during the pandemic.

Last week , The Center for American Liberty filed a federal lawsuit against California Gov. Gavin Newsom on behalf of the Professional Beauty Federation of California. It was an attempt to get hair salons reopened statewide.

5,000 miles away, stylists are worried

In Connecticut, Salon owner Odete DaSilva said she is among thousands of hairstylists and salon owners urging Gov. Ned Lamont to push back the May 20 date when salons and barbershops will be allowed to reopen. She said they fear the risks of getting infected with COVID-19 are too high to go back to work and allowing them to do so would end their ability to collect unemployment benefits.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs such a divisive issue, right?‚Äô‚Äô said Steve Sleeper, executive director of the Professional Beauty Association. ‚ÄúOur members are the same way that the rest of the country plays out. Half are thinking, ‚ÄòHey, it‚Äôs too soon, let‚Äôs wait and make things safe.‚Äô And the other half is, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs go-go-go-go.‚Äô ‚Äú

The sense of urgency led one Southern California hairdresser to create in her garage a makeshift salon, complete with a hood dryer and a shampoo bowl. She spoke on the condition of anonymity because she said her cosmetology license could be revoked but allowed USA TODAY to take photos.

Upon arrival, the hairdresser said, her clients have been instructed to text her rather ring the doorbell to keep her two dogs from barking and eliminate unnecessary noise that might draw attention from neighbors.

The choice to defy or abide by state orders that govern the hair industry has become part of pandemic politics.

After Luther was released from a Dallas jail, Texas senator Ted Cruz got a haircut at her Salon √† la Mode. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick announced he would pay Luther‚Äôs $7,000 fine, although the salon owner now has ample money to handle it.

She received more than $500,000 from a GoFundMe campaign that was started a day before she reopened her salon, and recently Luther started a nonprofit called ‚ÄúCourage to Stand.‚Äô‚Äô

On May 14, Luther told USA TODAY she was driving from to Michigan to offer support for Manke, the barber who is facing jail time after refusing to close his barbershop in Owosso, a town of about 15,000.

‚ÄúMy attorneys have been in touch with his attorneys,‚Äô‚Äô said Luther, 46. ‚ÄúEven if it‚Äôs just showing my face, I need to go out there and support this man.

‚ÄúRight now, I want to speak with actions and make sure everybody in the United States realizes that we‚Äôre getting our rights and freedoms taken away, and we need to take them back immediately.‚Äô‚Äô

Manke did not reply to interview requests.

'Everything is super clean'

In an interview at the small stucco house where she lives with two roommates, Harris did not speak about politics. But she spoke intently about health and safety, saying she recently completed two online courses and received COVID-19 certification from Barbicide, a company that sells products designed to clean and disinfect salons.

One of Harris‚Äôs roommates was helping her disinfect between customers.

‚ÄúEverything is super clean,‚Äô‚Äô Harris said of her makeshift salon.

But it‚Äôs unlikely the California State Board of Barbering and Cosmetology will be impressed based on warning it issued May 1 by social media.

‚ÄúThe Board urges licensees to follow the stay at home orders,‚Äô‚Äô the post read. ‚ÄúIf businesses continue to put public health and safety at risk by not following the guidance provided, and if circumstances warrant it, the Board may pursue disciplinary action against their license. This will not be taken lightly.‚Äô‚Äô

But last week, at the Sassoon Salon in Beverly Hills, the front door was open and a hairstylist was cutting a man‚Äôs hair. Neither were wearing a face mask. Susie Mutch, the global marketing director for Sassoon, did not respond to a request for comment.

In Brookhaven, Mississippi, Dedra Edwards said she's worried for hairstylists and barbers going back to work after her brother Eugene, a longtime barber, died of COVID-19 in April at the age of 46.

Dedra Edwards said her family thinks 46-year-old Eugene Edwards was infected with COVID-19 during a hair show in Jackson, Mississippi on March 15. Eugene Edwards was not wearing a face mask because the hair show was held before the state-at-home order was imposed, according to Dedra Edwards.

She said safety should be paramount as salons and barbershops reopen.

‚ÄúI know they‚Äôre using masks,‚Äô‚Äô Dedra Edwards said. ‚ÄúBut you don‚Äôt know the client you‚Äôre working with, and you can carry COVID-19 and not have any symptoms.‚Äô‚Äô

Safety was part of the motivation when the Center for American Liberty filed the lawsuit on behalf of the PBFC, said attorney Fred Jones, counsel for the group representing the beauty and barbering industry.

‚ÄúTell me, what‚Äôs safer,‚Äù Jones said, ‚Äúhaving (hairstylists and barbers) go from one kitchen to the next kitchen? Or having all of those ladies and men come into the controlled environment of the salon, where they maintain cross-contamination controls?''

After entering Harris‚Äôs home, Batinovich explained that he'd seen her on Craigslist, where a slew of hairstylists are advertising their services. The demand is high, several hairstylists told USA TODAY, and Harris said she averages between five and 10 customers per day.

She is charging $20 a haircut and making about as much as she does when she‚Äôs working at a Floyd‚Äôs 99 Barbershop.

Working with an electric razor, small comb and scissors, Harris needed about 20 minutes to complete Batinovich's haircut.

‚ÄúYou look good,‚Äô‚Äô she said.

Batinovich smiled.

Two weeks into the reopening of Texas, coronavirus cases continue to climb ‚Äî along with tensions.

Shops, restaurants, nail salons, cinemas, barbershops, beaches, gyms, offices, childcare facilities, and personal care services are among the businesses that have reopened to the public.

Bars, wine tasting rooms, bowling alleys, skating rinks, and rodeo events will reopen on Friday so long as they stay under 25% of their maximum occupancy rate. Zoos can follow suit next Monday.

Professional sports leagues, including basketball, baseball, football, and tennis, can hold events from May 31, but fans are not allowed.

Two weeks after its stay-at-home order expired, Texas reported its highest single-day increase in coronavirus cases over the weekend.

But that's not stopping Gov. Greg Abbott from easing restrictions.

The Texas Department of State Health Services announced on Saturday that 1,801 new people had been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours. That surge was partially caused by an outbreak in the Panhandle, where more than 700 cases attributed to local meatpacking facilities were recorded in the city of Amarillo, the Houston Chronicle reported.

As of Wednesday, the statewide tally has risen to 50,564 patients and 1,388 deaths, based on data from Johns Hopkins University.

Texas is one of several states that are relaxing containment measures that states put in place in March. Shops, nail salons, movie theaters, barbershops, tanning salons, churches, and beaches are open to the public.

Restaurants have also been allowed to reopen and can, from Friday, go from 25% to 50% of their maximum capacity. People are encouraged to maintain social distance, wear face masks, and wash their hands frequently.

But two people were hospitalized and around 180 were arrested after a wild ""Go Topless Jeep Weekend"" on Crystal Beach in Bolivar Peninsula between May 15 and May 17. Footage from the scene show people drinking and partying but not much social distancing.

""We been in quarantine, and I need to get out and party,"" Chelsey Coyer told KBMT.

Cases in Texas are surging after the state started reopening

Abbott has defended the fast clip at which the state is resuming business, saying its death and hospitalization rates are lower than in other states of similar size, such as Florida and California, the Associated Press reported.

So far, Texas has conducted 723,013 coronavirus tests, which is about on par with Florida's total testing but much lower than California's 1.23 million tests, according to the COVID Tracking Project. That means only about 2.5% of Texas' 29 million residents have been tested.

Abbott said in a statement that he anticipates the number of new infections in Texas to rise as the state doubles down on testing ""most high-risk areas: nursing homes, meatpacking plants and jails.""

""That is exactly why I established Surge Response Teams,"" he added. ""By immediately deploying resources and supplies to these high risk areas, we will identify the positive cases, isolate the individuals and ensure any outbreak is quickly contained, which is the strategy being deployed in Amarillo.""

Abbott's goal is to open Texas fully.

Gyms, offices, and nonessential manufacturing facilities reopened on Monday, but social distancing is still required, and none of them can exceed 25% of their maximum capacity. At gyms, showers and locker areas will remain off-limits, equipment must be sanitized after each use, and gloves are mandatory.

The governor announced on Monday that childcare centers can resume operations effective immediately, alongside massage parlors, beauty salons, and other personal care services. Youth clubs, including the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, are allowed to hold meetings with no more than 10 members at a time, all of whom must remain 6 feet away from each other.

Abbott also gave bars, wine tasting rooms, bowling alleys, skating rinks, bingo halls, aquariums, and equestrian events the green light to reopen on Friday so long as they stay under 25% of their maximum occupancy rate. Zoos can follow suit on Monday.

Recommendations on how to protect ourselves from contracting the virus that causes COVID-19 are everywhere, like washing your hands, wearing a mask, and staying at least 6 feet away from people outside your home. But not all risks are created equal; home, public transportation and the grocery store all have different challenges.

A blog post by University of Massachusetts Dartmouth professor, Dr. Erin Bromage, who studies immunity of infectious diseases in animals, titled ""The Risks - Know Them - Avoid Them"" garnered major attention for showing that some of the highest risk areas may not be what you'd expect.

A lot of attention is being spent on opening up the economy, but it seems like the highest risk is more likely your own living room.

The data suggests that most people will get infected in their home, according to Bromage.

Tune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.

So where are the highest risk areas in the community for getting infected?

""The general theme of what I can see is, lots of people together in an enclosed environment with poor airflow and usually some sort of talking or singing involved leads to lots of people in that environment getting infected,"" said Bromage, in an interview with ABC News.

Case studies that traced back COVID-19 outbreaks at the beginning of the pandemic, have found that the main sources of infections in the community lead back to the workplace, public transportation, social gatherings, and restaurants ‚Äî indoor environments, with limited air circulation, and many people spending a prolonged period of time in the same place.

Some of the biggest outbreaks, excluding nursing homes, in fact, that have been reported and traced occurred in prisons, religious ceremonies, choir practices, indoor sporting events, and even birthday parties.

""You've got a lot of people in an enclosed space with lots of huffing, puffing, or yelling, which just led to large outbreak events,"" Bromage said.

Being exposed to the virus does not automatically mean you will be infected. A successful infection is dependent on the time exposed to the virus and the amount of viral particles you are exposed to. For example, ""While joggers may be releasing more virus due to deep breathing, remember the exposure time is also less due to their speed,"" Bromage writes.

Scientists call the amount of exposure to the virus that leads to infection the ""infectious dose."" Although scientists are still learning more about how many viral particles lead to infection, they do know that sneezing and coughing release the highest amount of viral material into the air, and you're more likely to become infected if you're in a confined space.

A single sneeze, according to Bromage, has been estimated to release about 30,000 droplets that can travel up to 200 miles per hour, which means it could easily cross a room. A cough releases round 3,000 droplets that can travel around 50 miles per hour. These particles may drop to the ground or could hang around in the air for a short period of time.

In fact, a recently published study showed that speaking loudly in an enclosed space creates ""substantial"" risk of transmitting the virus to others. Prolonged contact and lots of direct talking, breathing, and yelling between individuals increases the direct exposure to viral particles, which increases the likelihood for infection.

The amount of virus a person release changes over the course of the infection and varies by person. This is dependent on the infected persons' viral load, which is the amount of the virus detected in a test sample from a patient and reflects how well the virus is replicating.

Many people are asymptomatic and may easily spread the virus, unknowingly, by directly talking, singing, yelling, or even breathing around other people in close contact. This is why the CDC advises that everyone wear face coverings in public.

Bromage underscores that the exact number of people infected by respiratory droplets versus transmission through touching contaminated objects like door handles and elevator buttons is unknown, which is why it's also important to wash your hands often and avoid touching your face. But the compilation of studies he wrote, ""serves to highlight that being in an enclosed space, sharing the same air for a prolonged period increases your chances of exposure and infection.""

In very high-risk situations, social distancing guidelines are not as effective because even if you are far away from an infected individual in a small, poorly ventilated enclosed space for a long period of time, a low dose of the virus in the air can reach you and over a sustained period of time may be enough to cause infection.

Bromage said that the activities many typically view as highest risk for infection like grocery shopping might not be as risky if you're spending a brief amount of time at the store, you're avoiding other shoppers, not speaking directly with people, and the store restricts the number of people that can enter at a given time.

Public bathrooms may also pose a risk, but for slightly different reasons, said Bromage. Bathrooms have a lot of high touch surfaces like door handles, faucets, and countertops.

So far, the science seems to suggest that outdoor areas and large ventilated spaces are the lowest risk areas for infection. Outdoor areas are generally safer because wind and infinite air space could dilute the viral particles circulating. If you are actively moving outside that also reduces the exposure time to any viral particles hanging around.

With restrictions lifted in some states, many Americans will face a new challenge: ""Just because something is open doesn't mean it is an instruction to go,"" said Dr. Andrew Noymer, associate professor of population health at UC Irvine.

Before you put yourself in a high-risk situation, Bromage suggests asking yourself, ""Are there too many people here and how much time have they spent here? Are there loud talkers? Singing or yelling? What's the amount of people in my area that actually are infected?"" If you are in an environment with a lot of people, you should also assess what changes the business owner put in place to lower the risk of virus spreading.

If you choose to meet other people, you should also consider their level of exposure and health status. Ask your friends or family where they have been, how often they go to the store and whether they have been staying home, suggests Dr. Henry Raymond, epidemiologist and associate professor at Rutgers University.

""It's not just about your health but about the health of those people around you,"" Raymond said.

If you know your friend or relative has underlying health conditions or is at an increased risk of developing severe symptoms due to a weaker immune system you should take extra precautions to avoid exposing them to the virus. If your state permits social gatherings and you decide to meet up, keep it to a small group and make it safe as possible by staying outside, Raymond said. Agree on some ground rules, such as: ""We don't shake hands, we bring our own food, we space the chair out at least 6 feet away.""

""The best course of action is to be personally cautious and personally responsible. We don't have a vaccine. But we do have social distancing and masks,"" said Raymond.

For the latest COVID-19 statistics, updated in near real time, millions of people around the world have been turning to an interactive, Web-based dashboard created by a small team at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.

From its humble beginnings, that dashboard has become one of the world's most authoritative sources for the latest coronavirus numbers and trends. The project has filled an information vacuum, providing the most up-to-date, comprehensive picture of the virus' global scope and spread.

The dashboard was born, as these things often are, under the influence of caffeine.

""We were sitting around a table. We were all drinking lattes,"" recalls Lauren Gardner, 35, associate professor of civil and systems engineering at Johns Hopkins.

This was back on Jan. 21. Gardner, whose specialty is modeling the spread of infectious diseases such as Zika, dengue and measles, had been paying close attention to early reports of a deadly new virus spreading in China.

At that meeting over coffee, she asked Ensheng Dong, a first-year Ph.D. student she advises, if he had been following news of the coronavirus. He had. Dong, 30, is from Shanxi province in China, and he knew there had been confirmed cases in his hometown.

""I really worry about my family over there,"" he told Gardner.

What's more, Dong has a lot of friends who live in Wuhan, which was then at the heart of the epidemic.

""I could see their numbers growing larger and larger every day,"" Dong says.

Gardner had an idea.

""She mentioned, 'Why don't we make a dashboard?' "" Dong says. ""I'm thinking, 'Yes. Why not?!' ""

So, Dong got busy, and by that same night he had created a dashboard showing cases of the disease, COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus.

Back then, his map was splashed with just a smattering of red circles, indicating a grand total of 320 confirmed cases. Nearly all of them were in China; a handful more were in Thailand, Japan and South Korea.

Over the months that followed, as the epidemic turned into a pandemic and as the number of confirmed cases grew from several hundred to nearly 2 million, Dong watched those red circles on the map spread steadily and fast, all over the globe.

""It's kind of a bloody map,"" Dong says. ""There's so many red dots everywhere.""

In the first few weeks, Dong was entering all of the data by himself, manually plugging the numbers of confirmed cases, recoveries and deaths into the dashboard. That quickly turned into a monumental task. Now, nearly all of the data are entered automatically.

As the dashboard grew more popular and demand surged, there were times when the servers crashed.

""Actually, if I ever knew that this project will go [so] big, maybe I would [reconsider doing] that!"" Dong jokes.

For Gardner, who manages the dashboard project for Johns Hopkins' Center for Systems Science and Engineering, it's a role that has become all-consuming.

""I didn't envision being dashboard person ‚Äî that's for sure,"" she says, noting that the dashboard she first envisioned as a valuable tool for academic research has evolved into something far bigger.

""I think what we massively underestimated was the general public's interest,"" she says. ""It didn't even cross our mind how popular the interface would be. ... People are just really desperate for information that they trust.""

The Hopkins team scrapes its numbers from dozens of sources, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, as well as U.S. state health departments and media-aggregating websites.

The dashboard team has grown from two members to a couple of dozen, and they're constantly working on new features. This week, they've added maps showing per capita rates of COVID-19 testing, hospitalization and incidence, as well as case-fatality ratios.

The team would love to have other data made available, including the race and gender of COVID-19 patients, according to Dong.

The Hopkins dashboard is open-source, made freely available to users. Thousands of other dashboards, including NPR's, pull the Hopkins data into their own. ""And I think that's awesome,"" Gardner says.

Beyond the snapshot of what is happening now, the data are also being used to do modeling, which in turn drives state and federal policy. ""We're absolutely doing short-term forecasting,"" Gardner says, ""looking at what are the next spatial hot spots. Where should we be allocating resources to better prepare for the next city or the next state that's gonna see a surge in cases?""

The Hopkins team also recently joined in a study from NASA, modeling how climate and seasonality are contributing to the coronavirus outbreak.

As the dashboard project goes on, Dong says what began with him worrying about his family in China has flipped. With the U.S. now bearing the brutal brunt of the pandemic, he says, it's his family's turn to worry about him.",Center,USA,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Meet The Team Behind The Coronavirus Tracker Watched By Millions,"Meet The Team Behind The Coronavirus Tracker Watched By Millions  For the latest COVID-19 statistics, updated in near real time, millions of people around the world have been turning to an interactive, Web-based dashboard created by a small team at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.  From its humble beginnings, that dashboard has become one of the world's most authoritative sources for the latest coronavirus numbers and trends. The project has filled an information vacuum, providing the most up-to-date, comprehensive picture of the virus' global scope and spread.  The dashboard was born, as these things often are, under the influence of caffeine.  ""We were sitting around a table. We were all drinking lattes,"" recalls Lauren Gardner, 35, associate professor of civil and systems engineering at Johns Hopkins.  This was back on Jan. 21. Gardner, whose specialty is modeling the spread of infectious diseases such as Zika, dengue and measles, had been paying close attention to early reports of a deadly new virus spreading in China.  Enlarge this image toggle caption Will Kirk/Johns Hopkins University Will Kirk/Johns Hopkins University  At that meeting over coffee, she asked Ensheng Dong, a first-year Ph.D. student she advises, if he had been following news of the coronavirus. He had. Dong, 30, is from Shanxi province in China, and he knew there had been confirmed cases in his hometown.  ""I really worry about my family over there,"" he told Gardner.  What's more, Dong has a lot of friends who live in Wuhan, which was then at the heart of the epidemic.  ""I could see their numbers growing larger and larger every day,"" Dong says.  Gardner had an idea.  ""She mentioned, 'Why don't we make a dashboard?' "" Dong says. ""I'm thinking, 'Yes. Why not?!' ""  So, Dong got busy, and by that same night he had created a dashboard showing cases of the disease, COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus.  Back then, his map was splashed with just a smattering of red circles, indicating a grand total of 320 confirmed cases. Nearly all of them were in China; a handful more were in Thailand, Japan and South Korea.  Over the months that followed, as the epidemic turned into a pandemic and as the number of confirmed cases grew from several hundred to nearly 2 million, Dong watched those red circles on the map spread steadily and fast, all over the globe.  ""It's kind of a bloody map,"" Dong says. ""There's so many red dots everywhere.""  In the first few weeks, Dong was entering all of the data by himself, manually plugging the numbers of confirmed cases, recoveries and deaths into the dashboard. That quickly turned into a monumental task. Now, nearly all of the data are entered automatically.  As the dashboard grew more popular and demand surged, there were times when the servers crashed.  ""Actually, if I ever knew that this project will go [so] big, maybe I would [reconsider doing] that!"" Dong jokes.

Every U.S. state has implemented restrictions designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. Businesses reduced or ceased operations, people transitioned into working and learning remotely, and nonessential activities were paused. At least temporarily, much of the country was under strict orders to stay home.

State officials are now charting paths to a new normal, seeking a balance between reopening economies and protecting public health. Many governors are outlining new frameworks and timelines for their states as they ramp up testing and contact tracing efforts. Some have also formed regional partnerships to coordinate economic recovery. Most are releasing general and industry-specific reopening guidelines for businesses and individuals.

President Trump's federal guidelines for social distancing and mitigation expired on May 1. Many states are modifying stay-at-home orders, prolonging school closures or delaying elections until after that date. Many are also lifting certain restrictions as they embark on phased-in recovery plans. And while more than half of states have partially reopened, public health experts say that some are doing so too quickly, as they warn of a second wave of infections. At a May 12 Senate hearing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S.'s top infectious disease expert, expressed concern about some states and localities skipping federal guidelines to open prematurely.

Governors have created their own data dashboards and task forces to guide their planning, and provide regular progress updates. Conditions and predictions differ across states, though there is broad consensus that reopening will not happen overnight.

Each day brings changes. NPR is tracking developments in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia so you can see what's changed and how states compare.

If you've been financially affected by the coronavirus, you can ask companies about their policies regarding late or missed payments.

Some companies are making exceptions for people who have been impacted by the coronavirus.

You might be able to pause payments toward memberships, credit cards, utilities, insurance, rent, mortgage, auto loans, and federal and private student loans.

Read more personal finance coverage.

Many employees are out of work or facing reduced hours as US businesses temporarily close to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Lenders are empathizing with people who are struggling to pay their bills during the pandemic.

If you reach out to companies, you may be able to pause any of these eight bills ‚Äî and make life a little less stressful during the outbreak.

1. Memberships and subscriptions

It may seem like we're beating a dead horse by recommending you cancel memberships and subscriptions to save money. But while people might normally tell you to cut out frivolous expenses like streaming services, that's not necessarily the best move here.

After all, you're going to be spending a lot of time at home. Is now really the time to delete your Netflix account?

Instead, think about expenses that will no longer be relevant while you're self-isolating. If your gym is closed indefinitely, pause your monthly payments. If you're a season ticket holder to an amusement park that has closed or for a sports team whose season has been canceled, call the ticket office to discuss cancellation.

In some cases, you may want to ask whether you can pause rather than cancel a membership. For example, if you cancel your gym membership, you might have to pay the joining fee again when you finally go back. Hopefully, pausing payments eliminate that extra expense.

2. Credit card payments

No one wants to miss a credit card payment. Neglecting to make a minimum payment on time can hurt your credit score. When you fail to pay off the full statement balance every month, you have to pay interest.

Thankfully, many credit card issuers are making accommodations for borrowers who have been financially affected by the coronavirus. Companies are encouraging these members to contact a representative to discuss their options. Some issuers are allowing people to skip payments without accruing interest.

3. Utilities

Companies such as CenterPoint Energy, Xcel Energy, and Minnesota Power have announced they won't shut off customers' power if they're unable to pay at this time.

Charter is installing free WiFi and Broadband for new customers, and it will remain free for 60 days. Arvig is offering free internet and WiFi to new customers who have K-12 or college students in their households. These customers won't have to pay until schools reopen.

Check whether your utility company has already announced exceptions for payments online. If so, call up the company to tell them about your situation. You can still give them a call if you can't find any information about special circumstances online. It's possible they're still willing to work with you.

4. Federal student loan payments

Under the CARES Act, federal student loan payments are suspended until September 30, 2020. No interest accrues during this time. You won't be penalized for skipping these payments, and your credit score won't be affected.

The CARES Act is referring to Direct federal student loans that are owned by the Department of Education. Private loans, refinanced loans, and FFEL and Perkins loans owned by private companies or colleges do not qualify for forbearance under the CARES Act.

The Department of Education has paused all federal student loan payments, so any automatic payments will be suspended. If you'd like to continue making payments until September 30 to eliminate debt more quickly, call your student loan servicer to reinstate automatic payments.

If you're enrolled in a student loan forgiveness program but skip payments until September 30, these months will still count toward your required number of payments to receive forgiveness, even if you don't pay anything. In order for these months to count toward your PSLF credits, you must still be employed full-time during this period.

If you've made a federal student loan payment since March 13, you can contact your servicer to request a refund.

5. Private student loan payments

Many private student loan companies are encouraging borrowers to contact representatives to discuss payment options. Some are making exceptions for people who have been financially impacted by the coronavirus.

Some lenders already have policies in place to accommodate borrowers who are out of work. For example, Wells Fargo's Loan Modification Program lowers your monthly payments. It also offers short-term payment relief, which lasts for two months. Most lenders also offer forbearance, although terms vary.

6. Insurance payments

Several big-name insurance companies are making exceptions for people who have been impacted by the coronavirus. For example, Liberty is offering auto insurance customers 15% refunds on two months of premiums, and GEICO will no longer cancel your coverage if you miss payments or allow your policy to expire through May 31.

Call your insurance providers to ask whether they're willing to accommodate your situation. Even just pausing payments for a month or two may help alleviate your financial burden.

7. Rent or Mortgage Payments

Numerous cities have temporarily forbidden landlords from evicting tenants who can't pay rent. Whether your city has released an official stance on evictions or not, contact your landlord to discuss your job loss. You might be able to set up a payment plan or defer payment for a month or two.

For homeowners, federal mortgage lending companies Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are offering forbearance for up to 12 months, and beginning July 1, you can request to put off repayment until you sell, refinance, or pay off the home completely.

Some private lenders are allowing forbearance for up to 120 days. Contact your lender and be prepared to show proof of economic hardship.

8. Auto payments

Many lenders are working with people who have lost their jobs as a result of the coronavirus and struggling to make car loan payments. Ally Bank is offering auto payment deferment for up to 120 days.

Some car manufacturers are extending a hand to borrowers, too. For example, Hyundai's finance team is allowing current car owners to defer payments for up to three months.

The union is in complete disarray economically, socially, and politically. As the block plunges into recession, anti-EU and anti-Euro sentiment is continuing to grow rapidly.

The ground zero for this sentiment is Italy. For almost a decade, Italy has been on the edge of facing a similar crisis to that of Greece. This has mainly been due to the large deficits produced by the right-wing Berlusconi governments. Since 2018, anti-establishment and anti-EU sentiment in Italy continues to grow, with anti-EU populists now making up a majority of the Italian parliament. Berlusconi‚Äôs party is now polling at 6%, while former centre-left Prime Minister Matteo Renzi‚Äôs party continues to barely make the polling threshold needed to enter parliament. When the coronavirus crisis hit, right-wing populists such as Matteo Salvini and Georgia Meloni viciously went after the Euro, pushing for a return to an Italian currency to better handle the crisis. They also criticized the European Union as a whole for its late response to the coronavirus in Italy, which forced the government to turn to aid from Russia.

Their push seems to be working. According to a poll published by Tecne, 47% of Italians support leaving the Eurozone and 46% support leaving the European Union altogether. To compare, only 41% of those polled supported remaining in the union.

Italy, however, isn‚Äôt the only nation in Europe where Europskepticism is on the rise. A recent poll suggests nearly 60% of France has no trust in Brussels, up 10 points since the election of Emanuel Macron. This comes as Macron faces increased pressure to resign, this time coming from the left as 10 of his party‚Äôs MPs have switched parties. Macron, a former Rothschild banker, often dubbed as a ‚Äúpuppet of the big banks‚Äù, has slowly been losing control of his country. As the Yellow Vest protests are starting to revive, the president is also being faced by migrant riots. Time will tell how long Macron can hold on. Recent polling suggests that he could be ousted in the next election by the far-right Marine le Pen.

As the union struggles to hold on economically, the idea of issuing Eurobonds is being seen as an option to satisfy Italy. That option, however, may be off the table as a German court recently declared it unconstitutional. Merkel has since announced she opposes the plan.

George Soros has came out in support for the Eurobond program: ‚ÄúA 1 trillion-euro bond would cost 5 billion euros a year, assuming an interest rate of 0.5%. The consols would not need to be sold all at once; they could be issued in tranches and they would be snatched up by long-term investors like life insurance companies.‚Äù The move would add $1 trillion of debt to the European Union as a whole, as if Europe didn‚Äôt have enough debt.

Along with Soros, Macron has announced his support for the plan. Unlike Merkel, who at times will turn on the World Order in favor of the interests of her own nation, Macron almost always carries out the interests of those who put him in power. Despite support from Macron, the move seems more and more unlikely as Merkel has not backed down in her opposition to the plan.

Will economic troubles lead to a collapse in the union? George Soros seems to think so. ‚ÄúIf the EU is unable to consider it now [Eurobonds], it may not be able to survive the challenges it currently confronts‚Ä¶ This is not a theoretical possibility; it may be the tragic reality.‚Äù

With globalist leaders such as Macron and Italian Prime Minister Conte on the edge of losing power to the far-right, economic troubles for the block may trigger the collapse of both the European Union along with the establishment governments within the block. Time will tell. However, since one of the main architects of the union already echos this sentiment, we may already know the answer.

As of this writing, more than 80,000 Americans have contracted and died from the coronavirus. But how many have or will die from what some call ""despair""?

Consider the following call to my radio show:

""Hi, Larry. I was calling about people who have called suicide hotlines and different things with this loss of income. I am a widow of somebody who did commit suicide because of income. It was not now, during the epidemic, but it was because of dwindling income and hopelessness, which he hid from me. I had no idea this was going on in his business life. And I came home from work one day and found him hanging in the garage. He did leave a note about the different debts and things like that, but financial problems are a horrible thing ‚Äî just a horrible thing that's worse than the virus.""

No doubt going back to work increases a person's chances of exposure to the COVID-19 virus. More will contract the virus and die from it than would have been the case under continued lockdowns. But this, of course, is not the full picture.

A new report, ""Projected Deaths of Despair During the Coronavirus Recession,"" suggests as many as 75,000 Americans could die from ""despair"" due to unemployment, depression from isolation, and fear of the indefinite and uncertain nature of the pandemic. One of the study's authors, Benjamin Miller, chief strategy officer for Well Being Trust in Oakland, California, said: ""Deaths of despair are tied to multiple factors, like unemployment, fear and dread, and isolation. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were already an unprecedented number of deaths of despair. We wanted to estimate how this pandemic would change that number moving forward."" The study estimates that there could be 75,000 coronavirus-related ""deaths of despair"" from drug or alcohol abuse and suicide. Miller explained, ""The isolation is causing people to lose boundaries on their behaviors. ... People have to be working and we have to get people connected to other people.""

About the study, Dr. Elie Aoun, vice chairman of the American Psychiatric Association's Council on Addiction Psychiatry, said: ""I've been seeing this in practices and my colleagues have been talking about it, too. ... Addiction patients are relapsing, and a lot of patients who don't have drug use or alcohol problems are drinking more now, sometimes every day from 4 or 5 p.m., and they don't stop until they sleep.""

Earlier this year, I wrote about the connection between suicide and unemployment. A British journal, The Lancet Psychiatry, published a study associating worldwide suicides to unemployment. ""Our findings reveal that the suicide rate increases six months before a rise in unemployment,"" said study author Carlos Nordt. ""Our data suggest that not all job losses necessarily have an equal impact, as the effect on suicide risk appears to be stronger in countries where being out of work is uncommon."" The study said that between 2000 and 2011, there were an estimated 233,000 suicides in 63 countries, and that the number increased during the last recession: ""While the number of unemployment-related suicides increased by about 5,000 during the recent economic crisis in 2008, this analysis shows the risk of suicide among jobless people is high even in good economic times.""

Unemployment stands at 14.7%, with over 20 million Americans in April filing for unemployment. The number of unemployed Americans is likely understated. Betsey Stevenson, former member of the Council of Economic Advisers as well as the chief economist of the U.S. Department of Labor, says due to an incorrect classification of ""people who were employed (but) absent from work due to COVID-related reasons as temporarily unemployed,"" the actual number of unemployed is likely over 20%.

A new ESPN documentary about the Chicago Bulls' last championship season describes how Michael Jordan broke his foot early in his pro career, during the third game of the 1985-86 season. Defying his doctors' expectations, the foot healed faster than expected, and Jordan itched to return to the court despite team owner Jerry Reinsdorf's fear not only that Jordan could reinjure the foot but that such a reinjury could end his career. Reinsdorf said to Jordan, ""If you had a terrible headache, and I gave you a bottle of pills, and nine of the pills would cure you and one of the pills would kill you, would you take a pill?"" Jordan responded, ""It depends on how bad the f‚Äî-ing headache is.""

Sweden has found that just 7.3 percent of Stockholmers have antibodies for coronavirus, despite the country‚Äôs laissez-faire handling of the outbreak. The mainstream media think this proves them right. It doesn‚Äôt.

Just last week, I criticized a piece of reportage in the Guardian, that grand old publication, for its remedial understanding of coronavirus. They are at it again, this time holding up an antibody study as evidence that Sweden, a land of dangerous wrong-think, is killing people with its coronavirus policy.

First, let us deal with the study itself. It reported that, based on antibody tests ‚Äì which are supposed to detect people who have had and cleared the coronavirus ‚Äì far fewer Stockholmers had had the virus than thought, which would mean that Sweden has a long way to go to reach herd immunity. But the thing about antibody tests is that they are utterly unreliable.

Also on rt.com Shameful treatment of the elderly is further proof Sweden got its Covid-19 strategy all wrong

There is no way to know what proportion of infected people generate antibodies. And even if they all do, we don‚Äôt know how accurate the tests are in detecting them. Therefore, as Professor Sunetra Gupta of the University Oxford confirmed on Thursday, the figure that comes out of an antibody test is a lower bound of the proportion of people who have been infected. A more honest reporting of the data would have read ‚ÄúAt least 7.3 percent of Stockholm had Covid-19 antibodies by the end of April.‚Äù

Sweden turns heel

In order to turn on their usual social democratic idols Sweden, the Guardian has had to spin harder than a hamster on a wheel. They have decided to find a metric on which Sweden can be made to look bad, and they have chosen to compare its deaths per million to the other Nordic countries. Deaths per million is a laughably crude metric that takes no confounding factors into account ‚Äì least of all the wildly different reporting countries use for Covid deaths. At the bottom of the Guardian‚Äôs graph is a disclaimer reading: ‚ÄúNote: counting methods vary by country.‚Äù

Sweden does score higher than Denmark, Norway and Finland on that particular metric, due in large part to their failure to keep the virus out of nursing homes. But in order to ascribe this difference to Sweden‚Äôs decision not to shut down their economy, the Guardian must establish that France, the UK, and above all Belgium ‚Äì well above Sweden in deaths per million ‚Äì have been even more laissez-faire than Sweden regarding the virus. But of course this is impossible.

Also on rt.com ‚ÄòSwedish model‚Äô of no-lockdown response to Covid-19 ‚ÄòWORKED REGARDLESS OF EXCESSIVE DEATHS,‚Äô its architect says

They appear to have found a Swedish Guardian reader, one Bjorn Olsen of Uppsala University. Olsen, taking the 7.3 percent antibody result at face value, and being a man of some education, has calculated that this is rather far away from the 50 or 60 percent required for herd immunity. ‚ÄúI think herd immunity is a long way off,‚Äù tooted the professor of infectious medicine.

But Sweden is not aiming for herd immunity, as their state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell keeps telling people. They are simply ensuring that hospitals do not become overwhelmed, rather than being scared of the second wave. You know, as was the point all along. When, by the way, did that go out the window? Wasn‚Äôt all of this done on the pretext of not inundating hospitals with too many patients at once?

Less rationalism, please

I‚Äôll give them this: the Guardian has a knack of unearthing quirky opinions. Another of their popular Sweden articles, which almost has to be read to be believed, is by Tae Hoon Kim, a South Korean based in Stockholm. Kim moans that he is ‚Äúworried‚Äù and ‚Äúnot reassured‚Äù by the Swedish government‚Äôs virus-wrangling.

Kim also thinks that Sweden‚Äôs ‚Äútendency to regard coronavirus just as a serious public health problem‚Ä¶ something that requires the careful observance of rules set out by health experts‚Äù has got them into trouble. Instead, he prefers to think of the loop of RNA as ‚Äúan ‚Äòinvisible enemy‚Äô‚Ä¶ an existential problem that calls for the state to suspend civil liberties.‚Äù

Also on rt.com Why is the MSM working overtime to try to show that Covid-19 is dangerous to CHILDREN - when so few of them have died?

But what do I know? Maybe Kim is right, and we do need more woo-woo philosophizing and op-ed psychobabble. Perhaps a few more celebrity renditions of Kumbaya? As long as we‚Äôre spitballing‚Ä¶

Swedes 1, Turnips 0

It is remarkable that even in a year with no Eurovision, Sweden has managed to make such a splash in the Western media. It is fascinating to watch them tie themselves in knots as they try to reconcile their image of Sweden as a progressive paradise with their new notion of a Scandinavian banana republic running a callous Darwinian experiment in which the old are sacrificed for the empty pleasures of the young.

Oh, how the MSM would have loved it if the one country to deviate from conventional wisdom had been Hungary, or the Philippines, or best of all, Russia. How much easier the smear job would have been had it been some poor, backward Latin American or Asian country, or anywhere run by a ‚Äúliterally Hitler‚Äù strongman-type politician. But they had no such luck; sensible, freethinking Sweden had to go and deviate from the party line.

No matter how much the MSM bury their heads in the sand, Sweden is running the safest, most responsible reaction to the outbreak in a world gone mad. The real experimenters are the lockdown evangelists. They are the ones playing with people‚Äôs lives, and it is high time they accepted that responsibility.

The owners of a New Jersey gym think not. They want to earn a living and pursue their American dream, and like most business owners and their customers are not stupid, suicidal, or children. They are American citizens watching their unalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness being ripped away by dime-store Napoleons who see this pandemic as a chance to pursue the liberal progressive dream of controlling every aspect of our lives.

Atilis Gym in Bellmawr, New Jersey reopened on Monday morning in defiance of Governor Phil Murphy‚Äôs Coronavirus lockdown order. ‚ÄúWe think so far, this has been just a gross violation of constitutional rights,‚Äù said Atilis Gym co-owner Ian Smith in an interview with Fox News host Tucker Carlson. ‚ÄúThe 14th Amendment states that no state shall pass any law that infringes upon our rights as citizens, and we‚Äôve been forced into our homes. Enough is enough.‚Äù

As some states, mostly red states, open up and people begin to regain their lives and their liberty, it is clear this toothpaste is out of its tube. American citizens are as mad as hell and clearly aren‚Äôt going to take it anymore. Many, like the Texas salon owner who risked incarceration to feed her children, are not going to wait for an official green light from governors and mayors attempting to usurp their rights, politicians who insist imposing a police state is for our own good. The owners of the New Jersey gym have found out that the price of liberty is indeed eternal vigilance -- and resistance to government tyranny:

A New Jersey gym reopened again Tuesday in defiance of the state‚Äôs orders against workout facilities‚Ä¶ and again police arrived to issue tickets to the owners. At least one patron was also arrested leaving the gym after refusing to give his name. Police also warned supporters gathered outside to leave or they could also face summonses. ‚ÄúThis gathering is a violation of the governor‚Äôs order,‚Äù Bellmawr Lt. Mike Draham said. ‚ÄúYou are directed to immediately and peaceably disperse. If you do not disperse you can be charged. You can protest from your vehicle‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs all we have right now.‚Äù

They also have the frightening words of the Democrat Governor of New Jersey Phil Murphy in a recent interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News:

Carlson asked Murphy about the arrests in Ocean County, N.J., of 15 men who were congregating for a rabbi's funeral at a Lakewood synagogue in early April. ‚ÄúThe Bill of Rights, as you well know, protects Americans' rights -- enshrines their right to practice their religion as they see fit and to congregate together to assemble peacefully,"" Carlson said. ""By what authority did you nullify the Bill of Rights in issuing this order? How do you have the power to do that?"" ""That's above my pay grade, Tucker,"" Murphy replied. ""I wasn't thinking of the Bill of Rights when we did this... We looked at all the data and the science and it says people have to stay away from each other. That is the best thing we can do to break the back of the curve of this virus, that leads to lower hospitalization and ultimately fatalities.""

The very Constitution you took an oath to protect and defend is above your pay grade, Governor? This is the attitude Americans are starting to rebel against. Elected officials such as Murphy are little dictators, little Napoleons whose true colors are being revealed, who believe in data and science but not the liberty and freedom of an American people who tamed a continent, split the atom, went to the moon, and beat Nazism, fascism, and communism.

Thankfully, some courts are beginning to wake up to these arbitrary and unconstitutional assaults on our liberties as free Americans unite and pursue legal action. In North Carolina, a District Court judge actually wondered what happened to the concept of equal protection under the law:

Democratic North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper‚Äôs restrictions on indoor religious services show a distrust of those who are worshipping, according to a ruling from a federal judge. U.S. District Judge James C. Dever III temporarily blocked Cooper‚Äôs restrictions on indoor services in a Saturday ruling, The News & Observer in Raleigh, N.C., reported. Dever said that Cooper‚Äôs stay-at-home order presents a double standard by only allowing up to 10 people at a religious service while letting businesses accommodate up to 50 people at a time‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúThe record, at this admittedly early stage of the case, reveals that the Governor appears to trust citizens to perform non-religious activities indoors (such as shopping or working or selling merchandise) but does not trust them to do the same when they worship together indoors,‚Äù the judge‚Äôs ruling said.

The judge did not mention that under Cooper‚Äôs order the Last Supper would be illegal -- an indoor gathering of more than 10 people. Freedom of religion is just one of our liberties under assault from authoritarians like Cooper. Business owners are being effectively deprived of their property without due process of law -- executive orders are not due process. Our Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms is under assault as ‚Äúnon-essential‚Äù gun and ammo shops are shuttered while felons are released as we are denied self-protection against them. We have lost our right to move freely, even speak freely, at least on social media that censors coronavirus response criticisms, or to peacefully assemble and petition for redress of grievances.

In Oregon, another judge similarly ruled the state was exceeding its legal authority by infringing on freedom of religion:

An Oregon judge ruled today that Gov. Kate Brown‚Äôs pandemic-related executive orders exceeded her authority. The case was filed by numerous churches and people of faith who were represented by the Pacific Justice Institute. The orders resulted in church, business, and school closings and required the citizens in Oregon to remain under virtual house arrest. The Oregon law gives the Governor broad authority in emergency situations; however, that authority is of limited duration. The Governor did not go to the legislature to seek additional time as required by law.

Not overruled at this point is Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who shut down Windy City businesses and put citizens under house arrest while the ‚Äúpublic face if the city,‚Äù as she calls herself went to her hair stylist. Lightfoot has cornered the market on tyrannical hypocrisy:

Churchgoers defying stay-at-home initiatives amid the coronavirus pandemic could receive citations in the Chicago area. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said last week the city was preparing to enforce restrictions meant to curb the spread of the coronavirus against houses of worship holding in-person services. After churchgoers decided to attend services anyway on Sunday, Lightfoot said in a statement that city officials are working with law enforcement to monitor large gatherings, including ones of faith, according to the Chicago Tribune. ‚ÄúThe local districts are reviewing reports of large gatherings that took place today at various establishments not abiding by the stay-at-home order,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúFollowing that review, the Department will issue and mail citations where necessary.""

Wisconsin‚Äôs Supreme Court recently struck down that state‚Äôs stay-at-home order as an unlawful order that exceeded the state‚Äôs authority:

The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Wednesday struck down the state's stay-at-home order during the coronavirus pandemic as ""unlawful, invalid, and unenforceable"" after finding that the state's health secretary exceeded her authority. In a 4-3 ruling, the court called Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm's directive, known as Emergency Order 28, a ""vast seizure of power."" The order directed all people in the state to stay at home or at their places of residence, subject only to exceptions allowed by Palm, the ruling says. The order, which had been set to run until May 26, also restricted travel and business, along with threatening jail time or fines for those who don't comply.

So far, such rulings are limited in scope and temporary. The assault on our Constitution and our rights is deep and broad and will only be stopped by a Supreme Court ruling that our freedoms cannot be erased by an edict from a governor, mayor, or a state health secretary. These orders are not laws passed by a legislature, and even then such laws should and must pass constitutional muster. As George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley observes:

""Pandemic is not a magic word that instantly negates all individual constitutional rights,"" said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University. ""A pandemic gives states a compelling state purpose in the imposition of restrictions. But when the state denies or restricts constitutional rights, it must satisfy a balancing test.""

Lockdowns have health costs themselves that constitute a compelling interest to not have them. Simply put, Americans cannot be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law and, again, executive orders do not constitute due process. There is no pandemic exception clause in the U.S. Constitution.

The orders resulted in church, business, and school closings and required the citizens in Oregon to remain under virtual house arrest. The Oregon law gives the Governor broad authority in emergency situations; however, that authority is of limited duration. The Governor did not go to the legislature to seek additional time as required by law.  Not overruled at this point is Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who shut down Windy City businesses and put citizens under house arrest while the ‚Äúpublic face if the city,‚Äù as she calls herself went to her hair stylist. Lightfoot has cornered the market on tyrannical hypocrisy:  Churchgoers defying stay-at-home initiatives amid the coronavirus pandemic could receive citations in the Chicago area. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said last week the city was preparing to enforce restrictions meant to curb the spread of the coronavirus against houses of worship holding in-person services. After churchgoers decided to attend services anyway on Sunday, Lightfoot said in a statement that city officials are working with law enforcement to monitor large gatherings, including ones of faith, according to the Chicago Tribune. ‚ÄúThe local districts are reviewing reports of large gatherings that took place today at various establishments not abiding by the stay-at-home order,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúFollowing that review, the Department will issue and mail citations where necessary.""  Wisconsin‚Äôs Supreme Court recently struck down that state‚Äôs stay-at-home order as an unlawful order that exceeded the state‚Äôs authority:  The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Wednesday struck down the state's stay-at-home order during the coronavirus pandemic as ""unlawful, invalid, and unenforceable"" after finding that the state's health secretary exceeded her authority. In a 4-3 ruling, the court called Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm's directive, known as Emergency Order 28, a ""vast seizure of power."" The order directed all people in the state to stay at home or at their places of residence, subject only to exceptions allowed by Palm, the ruling says. The order, which had been set to run until May 26, also restricted travel and business, along with threatening jail time or fines for those who don't comply.  So far, such rulings are limited in scope and temporary. The assault on our Constitution and our rights is deep and broad and will only be stopped by a Supreme Court ruling that our freedoms cannot be erased by an edict from a governor, mayor, or a state health secretary. These orders are not laws passed by a legislature, and even then such laws should and must pass constitutional muster. As George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley observes:  ""Pandemic is not a magic word that instantly negates all individual constitutional rights,"" said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University. ""A pandemic gives states a compelling state purpose in the imposition of restrictions. But when the state denies or restricts constitutional rights, it must satisfy a balancing test.""  Lockdowns have health costs themselves that constitute a compelling interest to not have them. Simply put, Americans cannot be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law and, again, executive orders do not constitute due process. There is no pandemic exception clause in the U.S. Constitution.

Editor, Health Impact News

There has been a debate going on in healthcare for more than 100 years. It started in the 1800s when two competing points of view were put forward to explain disease, and the cause of disease.

French medical scientist Louis Pasteur wrote on the ‚Äúgerm theory‚Äù of disease, while his French contemporary, Antoine B√©champ promoted a theory of ‚Äúterrain,‚Äù or sometimes referred to as the ‚Äúcellular theory.‚Äù

The following chart highlights some of the differences between the two theories:

An objective, critical review of each theory can find some merit to each approach.

For example, Pasteur‚Äôs work on unseen germs led to a change in practice for surgeons of the day, and many credit the work of Scottish doctor Joseph Lister for starting the practice of requiring surgeons to wash and disinfect their hands prior to surgery. Hospital-induced infections such as sepsis dropped so dramatically, that the practice of sterilization spread to surgical equipment as well.

But as an overall model for disease and health, many feel that Pasteur‚Äôs germ theory of disease overstates things in a reductionist sort of way that misses much in disease treatment. Holistic doctors today who supplement their medical training based mostly on the germ theory of disease, tend to follow the work originally put forth by B√©champ that the ‚Äúterrian,‚Äù more commonly referred to today as the body‚Äôs ‚Äúimmune system,‚Äù is much more important and effective in treating or curing disease.

The evidence to support this theory is that pathogens affect everyone differently, not the same. Even during some of the most deadly recorded ‚Äúplagues‚Äù or ‚Äúpandemics‚Äù in history, some people succumbed, while others did not. Usually those who survived far outnumber those who died, leading to the theory that the immune system is the key factor in not only fighting disease, but preventing it in the first place.

Of course today‚Äôs medical system is NOT focused on prevention by building up the body‚Äôs immune system, as there is no profit from that. Today‚Äôs multi-TRILLION dollar medical industry needs sick patients to treat to remain economically viable. Well patients don‚Äôt provide the same profit. See:

But just as Dr. Joseph Lister put into practice Pastuer‚Äôs theory of germs with great success in reducing hospital deaths, which might be great for preventing the deaths of patients already sick and is more of a ‚Äúhygiene‚Äù protocol than a health protocol, so too many physicians today are putting into practice methods that more closely follow B√©champ‚Äôs theories by bolstering the body‚Äôs immune system with great success in treating disease.

One such doctor that we have featured many times here on Health Impact News, is Dr. David Brownstein from the Center For Holistic Medicine in Michigan.

Dr. Brownstein has just published a report where he is claiming that his clinic has treated 85 patients for COVID-19 and that none of them have died, and none of them had to be hospitalized. He has also video recorded some of their testimonies.

So what treatment protocols did Dr. Brownstein use for this kind of success rate?

85 COVID Patients at The Center for Holistic Medicine: Zero Hospitalizations and No Deaths

by Dr. Brownstein

At my office, the Center for Holistic Medicine (CHM), we have had 85 COVID patients. At this time, no one has been hospitalized, no one has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and there have been no deaths.

There are five practitioners at CHM: Drs. Brownstein, Ng, Nusbaum, Jenny Drummond, PA, and Taylor Easson, NP. Since the start of the COVID-19 crisis, I have been asking my partners how their COVID patients are doing.

As of this week, we have had 85 patients either diagnosed with COVID or suspected COVID. I am pleased to report that our patients are doing well with this illness. (Note, since new guidelines have come out stating that any suspected COVID patient can be diagnosed with COVID, I am lumping COVID and suspected COIVD patients together for this post.)

I first reported to you about COVID on January 26, 2020. That was the first time I presented our protocol of using vitamins A, C, D, and iodine not only to support the immune system but also to treat viral infections.

In that post, I also pointed out how important eating a healthy diet is. The importance of using intravenous nutrient therapy, especially vitamin C, was mentioned.

Finally, I suggested that, with coronavirus, it would be wise not to get a flu vaccine since the flu vaccine has been shown to significantly increase the risk of coronavirus and other flu-like viral infections.

That post seems like a lifetime ago even though it was only 10 weeks ago. During that time period, my message has not changed. In fact, after witnessing the results our patients have experienced, I am more convinced than ever that a holistic approach like I presented above should be the first-line treatment provided to any COVID patient.

The human body is a true wonder. Given the proper support, it can do wonders. And, when the body is healthy, it can withstand and overcome an infectious illness like COVID.

The initial conventional approach to COVID was to encourage people to wash their hands (a good thing). As things worsened, the only other conventional idea was to quarantine. When the disease spun out of control our Government and conventional medicine panicked. They had no real therapies to help COVID-suffering patients except for supportive care.

Thankfully, a few conventional therapies, like hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, have been promoted‚Äîthough many in conventional medicine were downplaying it for far too long.

At my office, we were ready . The first 24 years of practicing holistic medicine was our time to figure out what worked and what did not work for people suffering from viral infections. That set us up to be ready for this pandemic.

In my blogs, I encouraged people to take high doses of vitamins A, C, D, and iodine at the first sign of an illness. In our practice, this was sufficient for the majority of our COVID patients. I (and my partners) have no doubt that the vast majority of COVID patients would avoid a deterioration of their symptoms if they started this protocol at the onset of symptoms.

However, some became more ill or did not start the oral supplements early enough into their illness. Those patients needed additional holistic therapies. These included nebulizing hydrogen peroxide and iodine along with intravenous nutrient therapies.

To protect our staff and healthy patients, we did not treat sick COVID patients inside my office. We were gowning up and meeting our patients at their automobile at the back of our building and administering IVs and ozone therapies. Some of these patients were very sick. So far, they all recovered. I have shared some of their stories via a skype interview on previous blog posts.

To watch a few of our patient testimonials go to:

There Is Still Hope Out There (3/28/20): Christopher

There Is Still Hope Out There (3/30/20): Jeremiah

There Is Still Hope Out There (4/05/20): Kendra

I think the end is in sight. We seem to be crossing over the hump of this dreadful disease. I have no doubt we will be in a much better position over the coming two weeks.

Folks, I hope the Powers-That-Be learn from this catastrophe. In the future, we need to focus on supporting the host rather than conventional medicine‚Äôs focus on killing the infectious organism. We do not have a vaccine or any other conventional therapy that is successful at destroying COVID.

In the future, I can guarantee you there will be other infectious illnesses that conventional medicine has no treatment to offer. Instead of waiting for the hail-Mary from conventional medicine, it is better to be prepared and have your body ready to fight back. This can be achieved by following my original instructions; eat a healthy diet, maintain optimal hydration, exercise, and correct nutrient imbalances with vitamin and mineral supplementation.

If you don‚Äôt have a holistic doctor, it is past time to find one. At my office, we are happy to see you or do a telemed appointment. If you are interested in this please email Ann Salomon at info@centerforholisticmedicine.com.

A holistic doctor can help you achieve your optimal health. Conventional doctors, on the other hand, are busy diagnosing pathology and prescribing the drug to treat that diagnosis. The problem with the conventional model is that the drug prescribed does not promote health as nearly all drugs poison enzymes and block receptors in the body.

There is a time and a place for drug therapies, but they are well over-prescribed in the US. The use of many drug therapies leaves the body depleted of vital nutrients that it will need when confronted with something like COVID.

As I previously stated, the Center for Holistic Medicine currently has 85 COVID patients who are all doing well and have not been hospitalized. There were some I was worried about‚Äîthey kept me up at night. I called them daily to monitor their progress.

Having them increase the frequency of nebulizing hydrogen peroxide and iodine helped them all. Some of the sickest were advised to nebulize every hour or two for a short period. IV therapies and ozone treatments have helped many.

This therapy has worked for helping COVID patients. It is sad that hospitalized COVID patients are not given the proper nutritional support when they are admitted.

In a perfect world, I would immediately start an IV of vitamin C and begin nebulizing any hospitalized COVID patient with hydrogen peroxide and iodine. I am sure that would markedly lower the need for mechanical ventilation.

Final Thoughts:

Like most holistic therapies, the earlier they are started in a disease process the better they perform. AT THE FIRST SIGN OF A VIRAL ILLNESS I ENCOURAGE MY PATIENTS TO START MY VIRAL PROTOCOL OF TAKING VITAMINS A, C, D AND IODINE. Due to the severity of COVID, I now recommend starting to nebulize hydrogen peroxide and iodine early into the illness as well.

Better times are coming. Keep me updated on how you are doing. I will much more to talk about in relation to COVID. More posts will be coming soon.

In accordance with the decree signed by Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, as well as the decision made by Moscow Region Governor Andrei Vorobyov, cemeteries will be open only for the burial of the dead until the end of the high alert mode (it expires on May 31). One is not allowed to visit cemeteries due to the coronavirus pandemic.

It is forbidden to deliver deceased bodies with confirmed COVID-19 to relatives for farewell ceremony. In accordance with recommendations from the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, the burial of those who dies of the coronavirus infection shall be carried out in closed coffins, and it is strictly forbidden to open them during the funeral.

Different regions of Russia practice different norms for the burial of coronavirus victims' bodies. In some regions, it is recommended to bury the deceased in closed coffins, in some others the authorities insist on zinc coffins or cremation, although cremation is not mandatory.

It is recommended to observe safety measures at all funerals, and direct tactile contacts with the body or the coffin of the deceased are prohibited. One is required to maintain social distancing and use personal protective equipment, like in any other public place. Employees of cemeteries, funeral agencies and funeral homes use special protective suits along with face masks and gloves.

Specially designated cemeteries provided for victims of Covid-19

Some regions of the Russian Federation have established regulations for funeral procedures against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic. Restrictions on the number of individuals who come to bid farewell at a funeral ceremony depend on the decision of the local authorities. For example, in North Ossetia, the presence of more than 50 people at a funeral is prohibited. In Moscow and the Moscow region, it is recommended to limit the number of people at funeral to 5-7 people maximum. In some parts of the country, those who died of coronavirus are buried at ordinary cemeteries, whereas in other regions, it is allowed to use only specially designated cemeteries. For example, in St. Petersburg, Mordovia and some other regions, special cemeteries and territories were assigned for victims of COVID-19.

Performing the autopsy of the body of the deceased is mandatory, and it is impossible to refuse from it, even if the deceased did not have the confirmed infection, but was only suspected for it.

The deceased bodies with the confirmed coronavirus are treated with a disinfectant. Afterwards, they are packed into double sealed bags, which are no longer allowed to open. Ordinary coffins are used ‚Äì they can be treated with a disinfectant both on the outside and on the inside. At some cemeteries, coffins are sprinkled with bleach on the inside.

There are some funeral firms that started providing remote services, such as remote funerals, remote visiting of burial sites, remote flower laying, remote grave cleaning, etc.

Death certificates may not always indicate that the deceased was COVID-positive. The cause of death may be stated as cancer, heart failure, autoimmune diseases or other chronic diseases, which, in combination with COVID-19, have led to death.

As of May 12, 10,899 new infections were recorded in Russia. The total number of infected people in Russia since the beginning of the epidemic has exceeded 232,000 people.

Specially designated cemeteries provided for victims of Covid-19  Some regions of the Russian Federation have established regulations for funeral procedures against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic. Restrictions on the number of individuals who come to bid farewell at a funeral ceremony depend on the decision of the local authorities. For example, in North Ossetia, the presence of more than 50 people at a funeral is prohibited. In Moscow and the Moscow region, it is recommended to limit the number of people at funeral to 5-7 people maximum. In some parts of the country, those who died of coronavirus are buried at ordinary cemeteries, whereas in other regions, it is allowed to use only specially designated cemeteries. For example, in St. Petersburg, Mordovia and some other regions, special cemeteries and territories were assigned for victims of COVID-19.  Performing the autopsy of the body of the deceased is mandatory, and it is impossible to refuse from it, even if the deceased did not have the confirmed infection, but was only suspected for it.  The deceased bodies with the confirmed coronavirus are treated with a disinfectant. Afterwards, they are packed into double sealed bags, which are no longer allowed to open. Ordinary coffins are used ‚Äì they can be treated with a disinfectant both on the outside and on the inside. At some cemeteries, coffins are sprinkled with bleach on the inside.  There are some funeral firms that started providing remote services, such as remote funerals, remote visiting of burial sites, remote flower laying, remote grave cleaning, etc.  Death certificates may not always indicate that the deceased was COVID-positive. The cause of death may be stated as cancer, heart failure, autoimmune diseases or other chronic diseases, which, in combination with COVID-19, have led to death.  As of May 12, 10,899 new infections were recorded in Russia. The total number of infected people in Russia since the beginning of the epidemic has exceeded 232,000 people. Over 2,000 people died, nearly 50,000 recovered."

With many beaches closed in Florida during the coronavirus pandemic, researchers see less plastic and less waste. There are fewer people and vehicles on the beach projecting artificial light; thus there is less disorientation for emerging hatchlings, according to David Godfrey, Executive Director for the Sea Turtle Conservancy.

Because of these factors, sea turtles can build nests without any disruptions.

Godfrey said that nesting season for leatherback turtles, the largest of all sea turtles, is underway right now, mostly in the central-east and southeast coast of Florida. They nest in fewer numbers than the loggerheads, who arrive in May. Later in the summer months is when green turtles will come.

It takes approximately 60 days for sea turtle eggs to incubate and for hatchlings to emerge, Godfrey said. Many disturbing things can happen to their nests when humans take over their beaches. They trample and dig up the turtle‚Äôs nests and harm them with artificial light.

With an inactive beach, the turtles can carry on the way nature intended. Godfrey said:

Less foot traffic improves the reptiles situation right now, but what will happen when the beaches reopen, and the sea turtles‚Äô eggs begin to hatch? Leatherback sea turtles will see hatchlings toward the end of April. Godfrey said researchers are working in uncharted territory, and only time will tell.

√¢¬Ä¬úThere√¢¬Ä¬ôs a lot of documented information about cannabis in cancer, cannabis in inflammation, anxiety, obesity and whatnot,√¢¬Ä¬ù said Dr. Igor Kovalchuk, who co-authored the study alongside his wife, Dr. Olga Kovalchuck, and a team of other researchers from Lethbridge. √¢¬Ä¬úWhen COVID-19 started, Olga had the idea to revisit our data, and see if we can utilize it for COVID.√¢¬Ä¬ù

√¢¬Ä¬úIt was like a joker card, you know, coronavirus. It just mixes up everybody√¢¬Ä¬ôs plans,√¢¬Ä¬ù Olga added.

The Kovalchuks√¢¬Ä¬ô have been working with cannabis since 2015, using varieties from around the world to create new hybrids and develop extracts that demonstrate certain therapeutic properties.

CBD reduces available ACE2 receptors for the virus to latch on to

For the study, published in pre-peer review server Preprints, the researchers partnered with cannabis therapy research company Pathway Rx ‚Äî of which Igor Kovalchuck√Ç is the CEO ‚Äî√Ç and√Ç cannabinoid-based research company Swysh.

The team created 3D tissue models√Ç with√Ç human oral,√Ç mucociliary and intestinal tissues and tested them with different samples of high CBD extracts. The extracts were low in tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. (Related: CBD√Ç vs. coronavirus? Potential natural remedies that promote immunity.)

With this setup, the researchers then√Ç observed the effect that the extracts had on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor that the virus uses to enter human cells.

The results of the researchers√¢¬Ä¬ô tests demonstrated that the extracts helped reduce the number of these receptors that the coronavirus could use to √¢¬Ä¬úhijack√¢¬Ä¬ù host cells.

√¢¬Ä¬úA number of them have reduced the number of [ACE2] receptors by 73 percent, the chance of it getting in is much lower,√¢¬Ä¬ù stated Igor.

√¢¬Ä¬úIf they can reduce the number of receptors, there√¢¬Ä¬ôs much less chance of getting infected,√¢¬Ä¬ù he added.

In addition to ACE2, the researchers also looked into other receptors such as transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), which allows the virus to invade cells more easily and multiply quickly.

√¢¬Ä¬úImagine a cell being a large building,√¢¬Ä¬ù explained Kovalchuk to CTV News.√Ç √¢¬Ä¬úCannabinoids decrease the number of doors in the building by, say, 70 percent, so it means the level of entry will be restricted. So, therefore, you have more chance to fight it.√¢¬Ä¬ù

Clinical trials still needed but exploring therapeutic options is important

The researchers√¢¬Ä¬ô early findings indicate that the CBD extracts could be used in inhalers, mouthwash and throat gargle products for both clinical and home treatment.

However, they say that people looking for CBD extracts to fight the coronavirus won√¢¬Ä¬ôt be able to do so at their local dispensaries yet. They state that the current medical cannabis and CBD products, while helpful for a lot of ailments, are not designed to treat or prevent infection from COVID-19.

√¢¬Ä¬úThe key thing is not that any cannabis you would pick up at the store will do the trick,√¢¬Ä¬ù said Olga.

With this in mind, the researchers are now actively pursuing clinical trials. They stressed that their data is already based on human tissue models, so these trials are a natural next step.

They also highlight the importance of exploring every therapeutic option when it comes to fighting the coronavirus.

√¢¬Ä¬úGiven the current dire and rapidly developing epidemiological situation, every possible therapeutic opportunity and avenue needs to be considered.√¢¬Ä¬ù

√¢¬Ä¬úWe need to bring it to the people,√¢¬Ä¬ù says Olga. √¢¬Ä¬úWe need to fight the beast.√¢¬Ä¬ù

""If our tankers in the Caribbean or anywhere in the world face trouble [caused] by the Americans, they (the US) will also be in trouble in kind,"" Rouhani said in a phone conversation with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani on Saturday.

He added that Iran attaches special significance to regional security and emphasized that some US measures in different parts of the world have led to ""unacceptable conditions"" but ""we will never initiate any tension or conflict at all.""

Iran reserves the legitimate right to defend its national sovereignty and territorial integrity and secure its own interests, Rouhani said, adding, ""We hope the Americans do not make a mistake.""

The Iranian president stressed the importance of strengthening joint cooperation amid the current coronavirus pandemic and said, ""However, the United States of America continues to make wrong decisions and keeps it inhumane approaches.""

He once again emphasized that regional security should be maintained by countries in the region, adding, ""We have always expressed our readiness for more cooperation with neighboring countries.""

According to Refinitiv Eikon tracking data, a flotilla of five tankers carrying Iranian fuel for Venezuela is approaching the Caribbean, with the first expected to reach the South American country‚Äôs waters on Sunday.

The shipments have infuriated the United States as both Iran and Venezuela are under US sanctions. Washington has threatened to take measures in response especially against Iran, according to a senior US official, who did not provide further details.

In a letter to United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres last week, Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif issued a stern warning against the provocative acts by the US which has dispatched its naval forces to the Caribbean Sea with the goal of disrupting the course of the Iranian tankers heading to Venezuela.

Zarif described ""the illegal, dangerous and provocative US threats [against the Iranian tankers]"" as a form of piracy and a big threat to international peace and security.

Venezuela's Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez said Wednesday that Caracas will send planes and ships to escort Iranian tankers arriving with fuel to the country in case of any US aggression.

He added that Venezuela's navy and air force will welcome the Iranian tankers bound for the Latin American country, seeing them through the nation's maritime territory and into port.

Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas announced that the Palestinian state and the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) will no longer adhere to the agreements they signed with Israel and the United States. It is a reaction to Israel‚Äôs intentions to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank. If Abbas‚Äôs intentions are consistently implemented, it would be a paradox for Palestine to abolish itself.

‚ÄúThe Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Palestinian state are rejecting any commitments from all agreements with the US administration and Israel, including those related to security,‚Äù Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said in response to the Israeli government‚Äôs intention to start on July 1 the process of annexing territories controlled by illegal Jewish settlers in the West Bank.

Abbas did not mention any specific agreements, but it is believed he is referring to a series of agreements signed by the Palestinians with Israel in the 1990‚Äôs ‚Äì the 1993 Oslo Accords, the 1997 Hebron Protocol, and the 1998 Wye River Memorandum.

However, by cancelling the Oslo Accords, could the Palestinian Authority be abolishing itself?

If Abbas is referring to the entire Oslo Agreement, it would in a way mean the dissolution of the Palestinian Authority, since they emerged from that agreement. Abbas‚Äôs reaction was caused not only by the intention of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to annex large areas of the West Bank on July 1, but also by the visit of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Israel, who undoubtedly supports the move.

Security coordination with Israel, which Palestine could be giving up, is one of the most important aspects of the Oslo Agreement, which has become a cornerstone of the so-called peace process. Security coordination is essential for the day-to-day functioning of both the Palestinian Authority and Israel. The Palestinian Authority is highly dependent, in daily terms, on this cooperation with the Israeli authorities. And not only on security, but also on economics, as well as on the inflow of financial resources, which come from the Israeli government to Palestinian institutions.

Even in earlier announcements, despite the interruptions, the essential parts of the implementation of coordination were never questioned. Abbas is now more serious than before when he announced and threatened to sever security ties which could be a blow to Israel, even if it means the Palestinian authorities lose the legal basis of its existence in international eyes.

Secretary of the Palestinian Fatah organization, Fayez Abu Aita, said that in these circumstances breaking all agreements, including the Oslo peace agreement, was absolutely necessary ‚Äì this is the only way to protect their territories.

‚ÄúIt is not our fault that we are now on the edge of a new stage, a new great confrontation with Israel. Only by breaking all obligations with Washington and Tel Aviv, Palestine has the chance to defend its right to exist, the right to own land. After all, we said that we would not allow the implementation of the Deal of the Century. The Israeli government only heard itself and its greed. But this was only the first step: the further the Israeli side goes, the more serious the Palestinian response will be,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere is nothing else left for us, considering how quickly Israel extends its hands to our land. They were the first to bring the situation to a dangerous dead end.‚Äù

If Israel annexes the West Bank, hopes of creating an Arab state within the 1967 borders will be extinguished.

While the U.S. supports Israel‚Äôs annexation, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday in a telephone conversation with Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazim confirmed the readiness of Russia to further promote the resumption of the peace process between Palestinians and Israelis. Russia is trying to prevent the annexation and, through diplomatic means, gather an international quartet with the participation of the UN.

Effectively Russia could be using this as an opportunity to present itself as a peace broker in the Palestine-Israel conflict. Whether this will be successful or not remains to be seen, but is necessary when it appears there is a strong chance that the Palestine-Israel conflict can breakout extremely violent again in the coming weeks amidst the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.

Abbas did not mention any specific agreements, but it is believed he is referring to a series of agreements signed by the Palestinians with Israel in the 1990‚Äôs ‚Äì the 1993 Oslo Accords, the 1997 Hebron Protocol, and the 1998 Wye River Memorandum.  However, by cancelling the Oslo Accords, could the Palestinian Authority be abolishing itself?  If Abbas is referring to the entire Oslo Agreement, it would in a way mean the dissolution of the Palestinian Authority, since they emerged from that agreement. Abbas‚Äôs reaction was caused not only by the intention of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to annex large areas of the West Bank on July 1, but also by the visit of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Israel, who undoubtedly supports the move.  Security coordination with Israel, which Palestine could be giving up, is one of the most important aspects of the Oslo Agreement, which has become a cornerstone of the so-called peace process. Security coordination is essential for the day-to-day functioning of both the Palestinian Authority and Israel. The Palestinian Authority is highly dependent, in daily terms, on this cooperation with the Israeli authorities. And not only on security, but also on economics, as well as on the inflow of financial resources, which come from the Israeli government to Palestinian institutions.  Even in earlier announcements, despite the interruptions, the essential parts of the implementation of coordination were never questioned. Abbas is now more serious than before when he announced and threatened to sever security ties which could be a blow to Israel, even if it means the Palestinian authorities lose the legal basis of its existence in international eyes.  Secretary of the Palestinian Fatah organization, Fayez Abu Aita, said that in these circumstances breaking all agreements, including the Oslo peace agreement, was absolutely necessary ‚Äì this is the only way to protect their territories.  ‚ÄúIt is not our fault that we are now on the edge of a new stage, a new great confrontation with Israel. Only by breaking all obligations with Washington and Tel Aviv, Palestine has the chance to defend its right to exist, the right to own land. After all, we said that we would not allow the implementation of the Deal of the Century. The Israeli government only heard itself and its greed. But this was only the first step: the further the Israeli side goes, the more serious the Palestinian response will be,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere is nothing else left for us, considering how quickly Israel extends its hands to our land. They were the first to bring the situation to a dangerous dead end.‚Äù  If Israel annexes the West Bank, hopes of creating an Arab state within the 1967 borders will be extinguished.  While the U.S. supports Israel‚Äôs annexation, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday in a telephone conversation with Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazim confirmed the readiness of Russia to further promote the resumption of the peace process between Palestinians and Israelis. Russia is trying to prevent the annexation and, through diplomatic means, gather an international quartet with the participation of the UN.  Effectively Russia could be using this as an opportunity to present itself as a peace broker in the Palestine-Israel conflict. Whether this will be successful or not remains to be seen, but is necessary when it appears there is a strong chance that the Palestine-Israel conflict can breakout extremely violent again in the coming weeks amidst the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.

Scientists from the University of Hong Kong have found at which temperatures the novel coronavirus remains most and least active. According to them, the virus remains highly stable for a long time at a temperature of about +4 degrees Celsius. In the absence of disinfection, its activity begins to decline only after 14 days.



COVID-19 is very sensitive to high temperatures: it dies within five minutes at +70 ¬∞C. At +56 ¬∞ C, the virus remains active for less than half an hour, at +37 degrees - for no more than two days, and at a temperature of 22 degrees - for about a week.

Scientists find how long coronavirus can live on various surfaces

On the outer side of medical masks the virus lives for at least a week at room temperature and relative humidity of 65 percent. Coronavirus stays on paper for less than three hours, on wooden surfaces and fabrics - for not more than two days, on glass - for less than four days, on stainless steel and plastic - for no longer than a week.



It is worthy of note that reusable face masks made of fabric, which many people tend to use nowadays instead of disposable medical masks (or due to the shortage of them) can be used repeatedly only after meticulous disinfection. As with disposable medical masks, cloth masks need to be changed every two to three hours of constant use.

At home, cloth masks need to be washed with soap or detergent and then treated with a steam generator or steam iron.

After disinfection, one should press the mask with hot iron without steaming it to kill all the germs that can live in moist fabric.

As medical specialists all over the world emphasize, such masks are intended primarily for sick individuals in the first place. They can be effective only in combination with other prophylactic measures (avoiding contact, frequent washing of hands, disinfection of items and surfaces, etc.). In addition, the mask should be worn by people who provide medical care for sick individuals.



Healthy people can wear the mask when visiting public places, using public transport, but the effectiveness of the mask in such situations has not been proven. Disposable medical masks made of non-woven material should not be reused or disinfected.

Coronavirus pandemic to end this summer?

Specialists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that 90% of cases of COVID-19 infection occurred at temperatures ranging from 3 to 17¬∞C and absolute humidity from 4 to 9 g/m¬≥. If their assumption is correct, warm and humid weather in the coming months may improve the situation in many countries of the Northern Hemisphere, whereas the situation in the countries of the Southern Hemisphere may worsen. However, this does not mean that coronavirus will not spread in countries with warm and humid climate.



For example, in Thailand, where temperatures remain at about 30 degrees Centigrade all the year round, coronavirus remains active and tough measures to combat it. At the same time, the novel virus is now actively spreading in Syria and turkey, where temperatures already near +25C. Some specialists believe that climate shows no influence on the new coronavirus as it has spread on all continents, except Antarctica.

A Silver Lining

By Robert Gore

Who will fight for your rights?

‚Ä¶we are fast approaching the stage of the ultimate inversion: the stage where the government is free to do anything it pleases, while the citizens may act only by permission; which is the stage of the darkest periods of human history, the stage of rule by brute force. Ayn Rand, Capitalism, The Unknown Ideal, Appendix, ‚ÄúThe Nature of Government,‚Äù 1967

We are no longer fast approaching the stage of the ultimate inversion, we‚Äôve arrived. It is the stage of which every would-be dictator dreams, where his whims are absolute, and everything everyone else says, does, or thinks must comport with those whims, even‚Äîimpossible though it would be‚Äîwhen they are contradictory.

Science is anti-whim. Nature, as Francis Bacon observed, to be commanded must be obeyed. Nothing illustrates the ultimate inversion of the official coronavirus response better than its leaders‚Äô assault on science in the name of their ‚Äúscience.‚Äù

Doctors have been discouraged or prohibited from administering hydroxychloroquine, by itself or in conjunction with other medications, vitamins, and zinc compounds, to treat Covid-19. They have observed and documented the effectiveness of such remedies‚Äîmitigation or elimination of the disease‚Äôs symptoms‚Äîbut their observation and documentation are dismissed. Only the validation procedure mandated by the medical bureaucracy‚Äîthe expensive and complex multistage tests required of new drugs to establish their efficacy and safety‚Äîwill suffice for official permission. It‚Äôs what their ‚Äúscience‚Äù demands of a cheap and seemingly effective remedy that‚Äôs been on the market for years as a treatment for lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and malaria.

So where were the tests and control-group studies for the pandemic models, lockdowns, social distancing, masks, flattening the curve, closing businesses, and contact tracing that have been the official coronavirus responses? Projections are hypotheses, but only one class of hypotheses was officially accepted‚Äîdisaster scenarios that fed panic and paved the way for further expansion of governments‚Äô power. The doomsday models have been discredited; cases and deaths have been orders of magnitude less than projected.

Countries that haven‚Äôt instituted lockdowns have fared no worse than countries that have. Andrew Cuomo, governor of hard-hit New York, recently expressed surprise that two-thirds of hospitalized coronavirus patients had been sheltering in place. As if locking people down‚Äîoften families under close quarters‚Äîin apartment buildings that can‚Äôt control cockroaches would somehow protect dwellers against a microscopic, easily spread, fast replicating, and virtually infinite virus.

No science at all supports social distancing; six-feet is an arbitrary construct (i.e., whim) of some medical would-be dictator. Masks force the rebreathing of your own respiratory waste, weakening your immune system for the dubious benefit of that all-powerful totem: public health. The health you‚Äôre supposedly protecting is certainly not your own. It‚Äôs like eating your own feces or drinking your own urine for a purported public benefit.

Flattening the curve to ensure adequate hospital space for the wave of coronavirus patients that hasn‚Äôt happened has flattened the hospitals, leading to empty rooms and wards and layoffs for medical workers. Bankruptcies will follow.

Lost jobs and shuttered businesses are just collateral damage for our would-be emperors, who have waged senseless wars and inflicted grievous collateral damage on other countries for decades. Now the devastation and misery they‚Äôve left in their wake have come home. Americans who‚Äôve never asked themselves how it felt to be a victim of their government‚Äôs senseless wars are now victims of their government‚Äôs senseless war on a germ. After an unsustainable debt-propelled respite, the Greater Depression has resumed (it started in 2008) and will last for years. Its poverty and devastation will sicken and kill multiples of the people who will ultimately be afflicted by the coronavirus.

All this supposedly guided by ‚Äúscience,‚Äù yet its proponents commit the most unscientific offense‚Äîthey corrupt their own data. By their own admission the tests they use give both false negatives and false positives. By their own admission they‚Äôre corrupting the death count. Doctors have been instructed to list Covid-19 as a cause of death if the deceased had any of the symptoms associated with Covid-19, even though those symptoms characterize a number of other diseases that singly or in combination kill people, especially people with compromised immune systems. Hospitals have a financial incentive to perpetuate this fraud. They receive $13,000 from Medicare for each Covid-19 patient and $39,000 for each patient put on a ventilator (Links here and here).

The coronavirus tyranny has nothing to do with science, medicine, or health, and everything to do with establishing that ultimate inversion: the government is free to do anything it pleases, while the citizens may act only by permission. These past few weeks we‚Äôve seen how our rulers attempted to discard the last fig leaf‚Äîdemocracy‚Äîcovering their creeping, now galloping, totalitarianism and complete lack of legitimacy.

A camarilla within the nation‚Äôs intelligence services, the Department of Justice, and members of the previous administration, including Barack Obama, attempted to depose the democratically elected president of the United States. Such coups are the province of two-bit plotters in banana republics that make no pretense of observing or protecting rights, where might alone makes right. The United States has gone full banana‚Äîthe stage of rule by brute force.

Democracy is tyranny of the majority, a system that inevitably destroys individual rights. For the history-challenged, individual rights were the still revolutionary concept on which the idea‚Äîalthough not always the reality‚Äîof the United States was established. The logical consequence of the full protection of individual rights is the freedom to live your life as you see fit, as long as you don‚Äôt abridge the rights of others. Society or any other group of people has no rights apart from the rights of the individuals that comprise it. Governments have no rights, only the duty to protect the rights of individuals to live peaceably and freely. Government must be the servant, not the master, of its citizens. (See the Ayn Rand Appendix cited above, ‚ÄúThe Nature of Government,‚Äù for a more detailed exposition of the proper role of government.)

We‚Äôre light years from that ideal. Individuals must receive permission to, among other things, leave their homes, hold a job, assemble with other individuals, attend houses of worship, visit parks and beaches, or patronize businesses. The governor of my state, Michelle Lujan Grisham, just decreed that masks must be worn by everyone outside of their own dwellings (I wrote STOP MLG‚ÄôS TYRANNY on mine). Breathing fresh air is now at the sufferance of our overlords. Civilly disobedient soul that I am, I have yet to don my mask. Don‚Äôt think sheep don‚Äôt get angry‚ÄîI get murderous looks from mask-wearers.

With every decree issued since this repression began, those who advocate for their individual rights or actually exercise them by violating the decree are denounced, shamed, censored, and in some cases arrested. Anyone who disagrees by word or deed is ‚Äúselfish,‚Äù unwilling to sacrifice for the common good.

What do they mean by selfish? Is it selfish to fight for your rights? Is it selfish to want to work and produce? Is it selfish to be more concerned with your own welfare and the welfare of your family and friends than with the welfare of strangers, the public, or the government that supposedly represents that public? Is your desire for freedom selfish?

There are those who will tie themselves in intellectual knots answering those questions in the negative, but nevertheless asserting that individual rights and their exercise‚Äîfree expression, free inquiry, free production, and free exchange‚Äîcan all be justified as conferring the greatest public good. They then wonder why they never win arguments with those pushing collectivized notions of the public good. When might makes right, the public good is whatever the collective‚Äôs masters say it is‚Äîargument over.

Fighting for one‚Äôs freedom and all that flows from it is selfish, profoundly so. If you don‚Äôt fight for that which is yours‚Äîthe individual rights that are the essential condition of your existence‚Äîwho‚Äôs going to do it for you? Anthony Fauci? Bill Gates? Nancy Pelosi? President Trump? Joe Biden? George Soros? Jerome Powell? Adam Schiff? Mark Zuckerberg? Eric Schmidt? Santa Claus? The Tooth Fairy? When was the last time you even heard the term ‚Äúindividual rights‚Äù in polite, mainstream discourse? When individual rights are mentioned at all, they‚Äôre treated as a quaint anachronism.

And what do they mean by sacrifice? They mean that instead of selfishly fighting for your rights and freedom, you are to unselfishly place them on the sacrificial altar known as the public good. You‚Äôre selfish for resisting the sacrifice of that which is rightfully yours, but those collecting what is not rightfully theirs are selfless saints. If you voluntarily board that cattle car, you‚Äôll secure your spot in the Unselfish Hall of Fame, along with millions of others who have lost their property, happiness, freedom, and lives without selfish protest or resistance. You might even be designated a Hero of the Public Good, posthumously of course.

If you find the world‚Äôs descent into evil unfathomable, it‚Äôs time to rethink the premises that the selfless is the good and the selfish is evil. Collectivist butchers, including the ones pushing the coronavirus hoax, always demand fealty to some cause greater than one‚Äôs self. Fall for that one and you‚Äôve already lost two important parts of yourself‚Äîyour self-respect and your ability to reason.

The precautionary principle‚Äîthat no risks can be assumed if someone or something somewhere might be harmed‚Äîis anti-mind and anti-life, absurdly evil on its face. That philosophical abomination now excuses wholesale violation of individual rights and deadly economic devastation based on projections, bureaucratic whim, and political expediency. The precautionary principle would, if consistency applied, bring human progress to a halt, eventually rendering the human race extinct. Nothing is as unsafe as an insistence on absolute safety.

Risk is what makes life worth living‚Äîit‚Äôs the driver of human knowledge and progress. Imagine the choices that confronted early humans as they made their first choices. If we build a fire, will it warm us and cook our meat‚Ä¶or consume us? If we eat oysters, will they nourish or kill us? Will the canoe we‚Äôve built float or sink? The forward steps of both our individual and humanity‚Äôs journeys have always involved unanswered questions, hypotheses, risk, experimentation, trial and error, tragedy, and triumph. It takes no imagination at all to envision potential risks. Make fear and safety paramount and none of those steps could have or will be taken.

To believe that risks can be eliminated by arbitrary edicts is delusional; to enforce those edicts tyrannical; to comply with them suicidal. Wars are always fought and tyrannies always established in the name of somebody‚Äôs safety. The betrayal of individual conscience and surrender of individual rights to a collective for safety‚Äôs sake never produces safety, only misery, destruction, despair, terror and death. That‚Äôs a lesson we‚Äôre set to relearn as we proceed through one of those darkest periods of human history.

There is a silver lining in all this: the curtain has been lifted, we now know exactly what we confront. Present governments and their many bootlickers and minions do not recognize‚Äîmuch less protect or hold themselves subordinate to the protection of‚Äîindividual rights. Nor should we expect that they will do so within our lifetimes. Absent their replacement via revolution or abandonment via secession, we will continue to live in a political order where they are free to do as they please while we may act only by permission.

If we want our rights, our freedom, and our lives, we‚Äôre going to have to fight for them with word and deed. It has ever been so; it will ever be so. Those who choose to fight will have one important ally: rule by brute force is the agent of its own collapse. It has always failed, it always will. Whether we have the virtue and wisdom to replace it with it‚Äôs antitheses‚Äîfreedom and individual rights protected rather than destroyed by government‚Äîremains to be seen.

Present governments and their many bootlickers and minions do not recognize‚Äîmuch less protect or hold themselves subordinate to the protection of‚Äîindividual rights. Nor should we expect that they will do so within our lifetimes. Absent their replacement via revolution or abandonment via secession, we will continue to live in a political order where they are free to do as they please while we may act only by permission.  If we want our rights, our freedom, and our lives, we‚Äôre going to have to fight for them with word and deed. It has ever been so; it will ever be so. Those who choose to fight will have one important ally: rule by brute force is the agent of its own collapse. It has always failed, it always will. Whether we have the virtue and wisdom to replace it with it‚Äôs antitheses‚Äîfreedom and individual rights protected rather than destroyed by government‚Äîremains to be seen.  Stay sane."

Now the redneck murderers ""downplay the deadly pandemic"" in favor of returning to work. Why is it so important to work, anyway?

The issue of unemployment and its micro and macro effects on society is broadly and globally researched in many disciplines of knowledge ‚Äî economics, philosophy, sociology, psychology, psychiatry, political science, criminology. The conclusions are unequivocal ‚Äî unemployment is much more of a deadly phenomenon than any virus. Unemployment destroys lives and the mental and physical health of individuals and leads to higher suicide and crime rates, as well as poverty-related diseases. It may cause civil unrest and disorder, catalyzing destructive processes within societies. Furthermore, mass and chronic unemployment results in or accompanies the development of undemocratic regimes that neglect and abuse individual rights and freedoms ""for the greater good,"" which legitimizes their absolute power. How do you count the victims of those?

There are obvious reasons for the importance of the employment for individuals ‚Äî for most people, basic life requirements are met through their work. 'Cause we are living in a material world ‚Äî aren't we, Madonna? ‚Äî we satisfy our physiological needs by means of money that we make by performing publicly useful jobs. We bring food to the table, pay bills and mortgages, travel and get an education ‚Äî maintain some decent standard of living. Income losses might force the unemployed to reduce their living standards drastically, which could influence both the physical and mental health of the unemployed, according to the Journal of Human Resources. Perhaps the simplest example would be substitution of a healthy and more expensive diet in favor of cheap and low-quality fast food. But even if there is no material deprivation, being unemployed could lead to anxiety about the length of income loss and the risk of a future drop in standard of living. Related to this anxiety is the possibility that joblessness can generate ""a feeling that life is not under one's control."" Employed workers may feel insecurity to some degree, particularly temporary workers. ""Those who are economically insecure, employed or unemployed have a lower morale,"" because certainly work is much more than just a way of providing for material needs. It also fulfills creativity and inventiveness, promotes self-esteem, and provides an avenue for achievement and self-realization.

Unemployment also creates stress by disturbing such important psychological elements as personal identity, time structuring, and self-esteem. It may also disrupt social support networks through the loss of social relationships at work, the abandonment of hobbies and social life under financial pressure, and withdrawal from social interaction because of the stigma of being jobless.

When people lose their jobs, their stress can manifest physically as well. These physical manifestations may be mild to severe. One might experience headache, muscle tension or pain, chest pain, fatigue, decrease of sex drive, and sleep problems. For many who are experiencing these effects, they are often not taking all the precautions to prevent these effects from happening. They may not be engaging in any physical activity or eating healthfully, which can result in more severe health effects. Scientists suggest that there are physical health concerns that accompany job loss such as increases in cortisol, prolactin, growth hormone, and cholesterol and decreased immune reactions. These physical issues can result in illness, which in turn creates a bigger need for health care and additional pressure on the health care system. It is examined that for every 1-percent rise in unemployment, deaths from heart disease, cirrhosis of the liver, and stress-related disorders increase 1.9 percent. Research conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health found that people who lost their jobs developed new medical concerns such has increased blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease compared to those who were continually employed. Of those who were laid off, 10 percent of the participants developed health issues regardless of if they found new employment.

Not only does unemployment affect the person experiencing unemployment, but it can also affect the family unit. Children of an unemployed person have been found to experience digestive problems, irritability, and delayed physical and mental development. It has been explored that this may be due to the parent neglecting his parental duties, often due to depression.

Also, please consider the toll unemployment takes on violent crime rates. A one-percent increase in the unemployment rate will increase the violent crime rate by 14.3 per 100,000 inhabitants, as suggested by the study of 2015. Don't Chicago, Baltimore, and Detroit demonstrate the correlation?

All in all, the evidence shows that unemployment has a grievous effect on both individual and societal health. Reopening America may not be reduced to the ""you want you kill your grandma"" and ""your haircut is not worth somebody's life"" arguments. The economy is not just some mythological creature the left evidently has little to no knowledge about. It is a fundament of living and of the lives of Americans.

This does not mean that businesses should not take all necessary percussions to decrease health risks for their employees. After all, essential businesses have demonstrated that it can be done ‚Äî why not acknowledge that ""non-essential"" ones can follow the lead? We need to reopen to save, not to lose, lives.

In April, despite economic hardships triggered by the coronavirus pandemic the gold reserves accumulated by the Bank of Russia made it possible to prevent the ruble from tumbling significantly, while maintaining foreign exchange reserves at a record high.

Financial experts are convinced that investments in the precious metal will serve a double dividend, by not only channeling revenue to the Central Bank coffers, but also helping to sharply reduce the share of the US dollar in international settlements.

Going for the Gold

In the last five years, Russia has significantly boosted its gold reserves, with the current COVID-19 health crisis and its fallout for the global economy confirming the soundness of this strategy.

Notwithstanding currency interventions in support of the ruble, soaring prices for precious metals enabled the Bank of Russia to retain gold and foreign exchange reserves.

In March and April, the Central Bank spent $6.6 billion, selling off $250-$300 million a day, according to rbc. As a result, the ruble lost some 20 percent of its value ‚Äì not as much as it could have given the fact that oil prices had shrunk almost threefold. According to the calculations of Gazprombank analysts, without foreign exchange interventions the dollar by the beginning of May would have been worth over 110 rubles.

In April, the value of the Russian central bank‚Äôs gold reserves grew by $6.244 billion, or 5.2 percent, reaching a value equivalent of over $126 billion, or 21.3 percent of the bank‚Äôs total reserves, according to figures released by the regulator.

Partly triggered by bullion‚Äôs growing worth as a stable store of value amid the global economic slump, the soaring gold stocks caused total reserves to grow by 0.45 percent in the month of April, reaching a total of $566 billion.

The past four months have witnessed Russian reserves overall growing a net 2.1 percent.

The Russian Central Bank‚Äôs international reserves, consisting of bullion, foreign currency reserves and special drawing rights assets, form a ‚Äúrainy day‚Äù investment fund for the Russian government.

According to the World Gold Council (WGC), in 2018 Russia bought 274.3 tons of gold, in 2019 - 158.1, and so far in 2020 - 28 tons.

This week, gold has been trading at its highest since October 2012, at $1,764.55.

In global markets on 21 May, Gold eased 1 percent to $1,732.43 per ounce, while US gold futures shed 1.1 percent to $1,733.60 per ounce.

""Gold seems to have lost a little momentum since breaking above $1,750 and the rise in the dollar today doesn't seem to be helping,"" OANDA analyst Craig Erlam was cited as saying by Reuters.

Analysts are convinced this is not the limit, as precious metal is the most reliable investment tool in a crisis.

The developments come as investor confidence in US government bonds has been rapidly declining, with yields on the bonds stalling near all-time lows.

In March, Saudi Arabia was one of the biggest sellers of Treasuries, with its holdings sinking to $159.1 billion, from $184.4 billion in February.

The Bank of Russia, which back in 2018 rapidly sold off the vast majority of its stash of US treasury bonds on the market, has slashed the remainder threefold - from $12.58 billion to $3.85 billion.

Strommer.

On 15 May, an out-of-state seafood worker tested positive for Covid-19 in Dillingham, six weeks after Bristol Bay regional entities requested the State of Alaska that it shut down the commercial fishery in the region. The feared at that time was that the state would fail to ensure pre-arrival testing and enforced quarantine for incoming fishery participants. According to Alaska Public Media, it‚Äôs the ninth case of a non-resident testing positive for coronavirus in Alaska. The state's governor, Mike Dunleavy, is resisting closure of the highly lucrative Bristol Bay fishery, vowing to maintain anti-COVID protection measures. However, tribal leaders have grave doubts about how the state authorities can enforce these measures and require seasonal workers to observe quarantine.

Why COVID-19 Poses Severe Challenge to Bristol Bay

""The main threat is due to the influx of thousands of fishermen who can potentially infect the vulnerable population with COVID-19"", says Ambassador Ronald Barnes of the Indigenous Peoples and Nations Coalition (IPNC), Alaska. ""The fish processors and their crew are entering the Bristol Bay region with Essential Employee exemptions stated in their application to enter Alaska by the state of Alaska. The exemption references to social distancing, quarantines, curfews and other restrictions. This also leaves protocols determined by the fish processors and boat captains to regulate"".

Ambassador Barnes emphasises that the local communities and the regional hospital are not securely equipped with personal protective equipment (PPEs), testing and tracing, ventilators, hospital beds, police enforcement and other necessary protocols to ensure the prevention and protection of the local communities to COVID-19.

""Many of the Bristol Bay communities are separated and isolated and can only reach the Kanakanak Hospital by airplane or by boat"", he says. ""The hospital receives mainly federal funding from Washington and it is not enough to serve the health and safety needs to all communities"".

The Bristol Bay region has had no reported COVID cases until 15 May, when a Trident fish processing company worker from out of state tested positive in Dillingham, elaborates Geoffrey D. Strommer, a US lawyer specialising in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) implementation. Stressing that the fishery industry has already brought COVID-19 to villages in the region, he draws attention to the fact that during the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic, 80% of the deaths in Alaska were Alaska Natives.

Even before the pandemic the health infrastructure of the Bristol Bay had not been constructed or staffed, or funded to cover thousands of seasonal workers: ""We already have huge unmet needs for health care funding, and this crisis only serves to highlight the disparities and shortages"", the lawyer underscores.

To complicate matters further, not all villages in Bristol Bay have running water or sewage and wastewater treatment facilities, he continues, adding that families often have to share very small housing units in overcrowded conditions which makes self-isolation almost impossible amid the pandemic.

Remote location makes life necessities hard to get and very expensive. Likewise, digital communications in the region cost quite a bit which dramatically diminish the affordability of telemedicine and distant educational services for Alaska Natives, the lawyer highlights.

According to some estimates there were 120,000 indigenous people in the state in 2013 which constitutes approximately 15.4% of the overall Alaskan population. ""Alaska Natives are the original inhabitants of the region, with knowledge of the resources, biology, terrain and lifeways to be able to live and thrive here since time immemorial"", Strommer emphasises, stressing that outside industries negatively impact ""local Alaska Natives' capacity to live a subsistence lifestyle"".

""Both the state and federal government, if they value what Bristol Bay brings to the regional and global economy through its fisheries, need to step up and invest further in local infrastructure so that the region has more substantial access to health care, housing, clean water and sewer, electricity, internet and mobile data, and education and law enforcement"", the attorney observes.

'Alaska Natives Have the Right to Govern Their Territories'

If the US state and federal government can't provide the indigenous people with protection and decent standards of living they should let Alaska Natives to take the reins of the region in terms of lawmaking, governance and natural resources management, argues Ambassador Ronald Barnes who has been spearheading the initiative of Alaska's self-determination and self-governance for several years.

""The lack of preparedness and infrastructure to provide enough health care is based on the failure to implement international legal and political status and obligations by the United States of America to Alaska"", he stresses. ""The US has and continues to exploit more than a trillion dollars of resource from Alaska"".

Referring to the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) and the 1867 Treaty of Cession of Alaska the ambassador emphasises that neither of these acts grant the US with the rights of jurisdiction and ownership of the region's territories. He underlines that these rights solely belong to the indigenous peoples of Alaska, in accordance with diplomatic communications between the Russian Empire and the US in which the Alaska indigenous people were declared as ""independent tribes inhabiting an independent territory"".

""The extraction of resources and unilateral taking of territory without the proper consent of a state of peoples based on the denial of self-determination and self-government on grounds of racial discrimination is a crime against humanity"", argues the ambassador. ""The Indigenous Peoples of Alaska have the right of full diplomatic recognition under the political question doctrine at high levels with the United States Government and with the international community"".

¬© Sputnik / Alfred de Zayas Alaska

Five years ago, Ambassador Barnes raised the issue in the United Nations together with the representatives of indigenous populations of Hawaii. As both Alaska and Hawaii were listed in 1946 as Non Self-Governing Territories under article 73 of the UN Charter, this status subjected Alaska and Hawaii to ""decolonization"". Irregularities in the referendum on Alaska's status as the US' 49th state throw the Alaska Statehood Act signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in July 1958 into question and require the region's re-enlistment to the List of Non-Self-Governing Territories, according to Barnes.

In 2013 and 2014 the criteria for exercising the right of self-determination by Alaska Natives were laid down by Professor Alfred de Zayas, then UN Independent Expert on International Order, who argued that the peoples of Alaska can invoke the right. According to the professor, ""the US government's failure to provide Alaska Natives with adequate health services before and during the COVID pandemic is incompatible with Article 25 of the 1989 ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention 169, the 2007 UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous peoples, and general principles of international human rights law"".

Ambassador Ronald Barnes concludes: ""The denial to grant proper recognition and respect to the Tribal Governments and for their right to development, particularly in developing law and policy by the proper agents and authorities, is contrary to the obligations of the United States under Article 1 of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights"".

On 15 May, an out-of-state seafood worker tested positive for Covid-19 in Dillingham, six weeks after Bristol Bay regional entities requested the State of Alaska that it shut down the commercial fishery in the region. The feared at that time was that the state would fail to ensure pre-arrival testing and enforced quarantine for incoming fishery participants. According to Alaska Public Media, it‚Äôs the ninth case of a non-resident testing positive for coronavirus in Alaska. The state's governor, Mike Dunleavy, is resisting closure of the highly lucrative Bristol Bay fishery, vowing to maintain anti-COVID protection measures. However, tribal leaders have grave doubts about how the state authorities can enforce these measures and require seasonal workers to observe quarantine.  Why COVID-19 Poses Severe Challenge to Bristol Bay  ""The main threat is due to the influx of thousands of fishermen who can potentially infect the vulnerable population with COVID-19"", says Ambassador Ronald Barnes of the Indigenous Peoples and Nations Coalition (IPNC), Alaska. ""The fish processors and their crew are entering the Bristol Bay region with Essential Employee exemptions stated in their application to enter Alaska by the state of Alaska. The exemption references to social distancing, quarantines, curfews and other restrictions. This also leaves protocols determined by the fish processors and boat captains to regulate"".  Ambassador Barnes emphasises that the local communities and the regional hospital are not securely equipped with personal protective equipment (PPEs), testing and tracing, ventilators, hospital beds, police enforcement and other necessary protocols to ensure the prevention and protection of the local communities to COVID-19.  ""Many of the Bristol Bay communities are separated and isolated and can only reach the Kanakanak Hospital by airplane or by boat"", he says. ""The hospital receives mainly federal funding from Washington and it is not enough to serve the health and safety needs to all communities"".  The Bristol Bay region has had no reported COVID cases until 15 May, when a Trident fish processing company worker from out of state tested positive in Dillingham, elaborates Geoffrey D. Strommer, a US lawyer specialising in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) implementation. Stressing that the fishery industry has already brought COVID-19 to villages in the region, he draws attention to the fact that during the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic, 80% of the deaths in Alaska were Alaska Natives.  ¬© Sputnik / Alfred de Zayas Alaska Native culture  Even before the pandemic the health infrastructure of the Bristol Bay had not been constructed or staffed, or funded to cover thousands of seasonal workers: ""We already have huge unmet needs for health care funding, and this crisis only serves to highlight the disparities and shortages"", the lawyer underscores.  To complicate matters further, not all villages in Bristol Bay have running water or sewage and wastewater treatment facilities, he continues, adding that families often have to share very small housing units in overcrowded conditions which makes self-isolation almost impossible amid the pandemic.  Remote location makes life necessities hard to get and very expensive. Likewise, digital communications in the region cost quite a bit which dramatically diminish the affordability of telemedicine and distant educational services for Alaska Natives, the lawyer highlights.  According to some estimates there were 120,000 indigenous people in the state in 2013 which constitutes approximately 15.4% of the overall Alaskan population. ""Alaska Natives are the original inhabitants of the region, with knowledge of the resources, biology, terrain and lifeways to be able to live and thrive here since time immemorial"", Strommer emphasises, stressing that outside industries negatively impact ""local Alaska Natives' capacity to live a subsistence lifestyle"".  ""Both the state and federal government, if they value what Bristol Bay brings to the regional and global economy through its fisheries, need to step up and invest further in local infrastructure so that the region has more substantial access to health care, housing, clean water and sewer, electricity, internet and mobile data, and education and law enforcement"", the attorney observes.  ¬© Sputnik / Alfred de Zayas Alaska Native culture  'Alaska Natives Have the Right to Govern Their Territories'  If the US state and federal government can't provide the indigenous people with protection and decent standards of living they should let Alaska Natives to take the reins of the region in terms of lawmaking, governance and natural resources management, argues Ambassador Ronald Barnes who has been spearheading the initiative of Alaska's self-determination and self-governance for several years.  ""The lack of preparedness and infrastructure to provide enough health care is based on the failure to implement international legal and political status and obligations by the United States of America to Alaska"", he stresses. ""The US has and continues to exploit more than a trillion dollars of resource from Alaska"".  Referring to the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) and the 1867 Treaty of Cession of Alaska the ambassador emphasises that neither of these acts grant the US with the rights of jurisdiction and ownership of the region's territories. He underlines that these rights solely belong to the indigenous peoples of Alaska, in accordance with diplomatic communications between the Russian Empire and the US in which the Alaska indigenous people were declared as ""independent tribes inhabiting an independent territory"".  ""The extraction of resources and unilateral taking of territory without the proper consent of a state of peoples based on the denial of self-determination and self-government on grounds of racial discrimination is a crime against humanity"", argues the ambassador. ""The Indigenous Peoples of Alaska have the right of full diplomatic recognition under the political question doctrine at high levels with the United States Government and with the international community"".  ¬© Sputnik / Alfred de Zayas Alaska  Five years ago, Ambassador Barnes raised the issue in the United Nations together with the representatives of indigenous populations of Hawaii. As both Alaska and Hawaii were listed in 1946 as Non Self-Governing Territories under article 73 of the UN Charter, this status subjected Alaska and Hawaii to ""decolonization"". Irregularities in the referendum on Alaska's status as the US' 49th state throw the Alaska Statehood Act signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in July 1958 into question and require the region's re-enlistment to the List of Non-Self-Governing Territories, according to Barnes.  In 2013 and 2014 the criteria for exercising the right of self-determination by Alaska Natives were laid down by Professor Alfred de Zayas, then UN Independent Expert on International Order, who argued that the peoples of Alaska can invoke the right. According to the professor, ""the US government's failure to provide Alaska Natives with adequate health services before and during the COVID pandemic is incompatible with Article 25 of the 1989 ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention 169, the 2007 UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous peoples, and general principles of international human rights law"".  Ambassador Ronald Barnes concludes: ""The denial to grant proper recognition and respect to the Tribal Governments and for their right to development, particularly in developing law and policy by the proper agents and authorities, is contrary to the obligations of the United States under Article 1 of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights"".

The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation for the Republic of Ingushetia is looking into the appeal submitted from the Legal Initiative project with a request to investigate into the case of female circumcision, when a nine-year-old girl was circumcised at a local private clinic.

Doctors, medical personnel and administration of ‚ÄúAybolit‚Äù clinic can be prosecuted for causing harm to health, committing sexual acts and providing unsafe services with a view to receive financial profit.

The victim‚Äôs mother said that she had separated from the child‚Äôs father a long time ago and kept the children. On June 21, 2019, the woman‚Äôs ex-spouse took his son and daughter to his house for the weekend. The next day, the boy called his mother and said that his sister returned home in blood and tearful. It turned out that the girl‚Äôs stepmother, her father‚Äôs second wife, took the little girl to Aybolit clinic in the city of Magas. Children's gynecologist Izanya Nalgieva conducted the circumcision procedure against the girl‚Äôs will. The girl‚Äôs grandmother said with reference to what her granddaughter told her, that the child was screaming and trying to break free, but her stepmother and clinic employee were holding her arms and legs. The adults were telling her that it was a common procedure for every girl, that she was not going to die.

There was no legal representative with the child at the moment of surgery. No one signed the consent for the surgery either. The doctor had no right to touch the patient.

On June 27, 2019, the girl‚Äôs mother went to the Investigative Committee Directorate for Chechnya (at her place of residence). A criminal case was filed against the children‚Äôs gynecologist under Part 1 of Art. 115 of the Criminal Code (intentional infliction of insignificant bodily harm, which caused a short-term health disorder or an insignificant loss of general earning capacity).

The gynecologist, a week after the incident, admitted the case of circumcision. However, an extract from the interrogation protocol states that ""the child‚Äôs parents agreed to skin incision in the area of the clitoris, after which the procedure was performed.""

A forensic medical examination established that the girl had ‚Äúa 6x5 millimeter cut wound on her external genitalia.‚Äù

Later, during an interrogation, children's gynecologist Nalgieva stated that she simply provided the girl with medical care and did not perform any surgery. ""I read my protocol inattentively and erroneously indicated that the ritual of circumcision was performed. At that time I did not have all that information memorized, because I did not have the health record available to me,‚Äù explained Nalgieva.

A representative of the clinic, Beslan Matiev, denied all the charges and said that the girl‚Äôs family simply wanted to make money on the reputation of the clinic. When the affected party produced the price list of the clinic, where circumcision was listed in the ‚Äúgynecology‚Äù section with a price of 2,000 rubles, Matiev said that the price list had been ‚Äúcorrected‚Äù because the clinic had no position for female circumcisions.

Ingushetia‚Äôs Commissioner for Human Rights, Dzhambulat Ozdoev, stated that he was ready to consider the statement from the girl‚Äôs family. ‚ÄúOf course, something needs to be done. So far we only have information from the Internet ‚Äì this is the only case of the procedure,‚Äù the official said.

The trial of children‚Äôs gynecologist Nalgieva began in late 2019 and was the first incident in the Russian judicial system, when a case of female genital mutilation was considered in court. The trial is still pending. The judge repeatedly proposed reconciliation of the parties, but it did not take place, and the court hearings continued until the introduction of restrictive measures in connection with the coronavirus pandemic. The trial is to resume after the lockdown measures are lifted.

Representatives of the Ministry of Health of Ingushetia later announced that such surgeries are not conducted in public medical organizations of the republic, while the ministry does not regulate the activities of private clinics.

According to international standards, female genital mutilation may lead to extremely negative consequences for women's reproductive, psychological and sexual health. The UN and the WHO repeatedly called female genital mutilation a violation of the right to health and freedom from torture.

The European Court of Human Rights recognizes female genital mutilation as torture that violates Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

Hogue is defending his beliefs after the release of an email in which he requests that only male members of a Christian missionary group say a prayer before a City Council meeting.

The exchange between Hogue and the city‚Äôs mayor pro tem, Jeff Forrester, was posted Wednesday on a Facebook page that focuses on the city‚Äôs politics.

Forrester emailed Hogue last week about the group, Youth With a Mission, asking for the mayor‚Äôs thoughts about arranging for its members to attend the council‚Äôs next meeting.

On Sunday, Hogue replied, saying it was a good idea ‚Äî as long as ‚Äúthose leading the public prayer be young men.‚Äù

Wylie Mayor Eric Hogue sent the email to Mayor Pro Tem Jeff Forrester on Sunday. ((custom credit))

Hogue, who also is the minister of Wylie‚Äôs Cottonwood Church of Christ, quoted two New Testament verses he said he interprets literally.

The first, 1 Corinthians 14:34-35, says: ‚ÄúLet your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.‚Äù

The mayor also quoted a passage from 1 Timothy that says, ‚ÄúLet the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.‚Äù

Hogue wrote that he has always asked for men to lead invocation, while acknowledging that ‚Äúnot everyone may agree with me, but I can‚Äôt go against my conscience.‚Äù

Hogue did not respond to a request for comment from The Dallas Morning News, but he spoke to local television stations about the email, telling KXAS-TV (NBC5) that his belief extends only to public acts of religion.

‚ÄúWhat I will say is a woman can do absolutely anything and everything ‚Äî but if we‚Äôre in a public setting, in a religious setting, the Bible teaches that she‚Äôs not to say a public prayer or to lead the singing or to deliver the sermon,‚Äù he said.

He reiterated that to WFAA-TV (Channel 8), saying, ‚ÄúI believe a lady can be president of the United States. I believe a lady can be CEO of a company, the superintendent of a school district.‚Äù But in the Church of Christ, he said, women don‚Äôt lead worship services or singing ‚Äî only classes for women and children.

Hogue also pointed to his 33-year marriage as a sign of his respect for women.

‚ÄúMy wife would not stick around if I was anti, you know, like that,‚Äù he told WFAA. ‚ÄúI mean, we are equal partners in everything.‚Äù

Forrester told WFAA he doesn‚Äôt share the mayor‚Äôs beliefs and was surprised by the email, but he added, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never observed Mayor Hogue ever speak ill of women.‚Äù

Hogue, 56, has been Wylie‚Äôs mayor for 12 years and is not seeking re-election this year. In addition to leading the church, he is a professional magician and formerly performed as a clown named Clinky.

Hogue told NBC5 that he suspects the outcry over his email may be motivated by politics after this month‚Äôs election was moved to November because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Clementine, is this a similar joke to: 'Honestly, the corona virus isn't killing black people fast enough' or 'Honestly, the corona virus isn't killing disabled people fast enough'or 'Honestly, the corona virus isn't killing health care workers fast enough'? ‚Äî Dr Pete Jones (@fatwhitebloke) May 23, 2020  I‚Äôve supported your position so many times in the past, but this is an appalling thing to say. ‚Äî Marissa Kate (@DrMarissaKate) May 23, 2020  I note Clementines books increased in sales over the Covid period.

This take makes no sense if you actually read the article which takes both men and women far more seriously than your callous response does.

According to research by University College London, based on the data collected on 206,128 patients, men were twice as likely to require intensive care, and 60 percent more likely to die after being infected wIth COVID-19.  Facing strong backlash, Ford deleted the tweet, apologizing in a subsequent series of tweets for not ""framing her argument"" clearly and describing her tweet as ""poorly judged"".

1655,1655,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-21-china-finally-admits-it-destroyed-coronavirus-samples.html,Natural News,21/05/2020,['Isabelle Z.'],China finally admits it destroyed coronavirus samples but claims it was done for ‚Äúsafety‚Äù,https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2020/05/Scientist-Lab-Samples-Coronavirus.jpg,"(Natural News) China has finally admitted to destroying samples of coronavirus early in the outbreak, but they√¢¬Ä¬ôre insisting they did it out of safety concerns rather than as part of any sort of coverup. Given their track record, however, doubts remain about the true motivation behind the move.

A supervisor for China√¢¬Ä¬ôs National Health Commission, Liu Dengfeng, finally admitted in a news conference that the government there issued an order on January 3 directing some facilities to dispose of coronavirus samples. Liu said the order was a measure that aimed to √¢¬Ä¬úprevent the risk to laboratory biological safety and prevent secondary disasters caused by unidentified pathogens.‚Äù

Liu added that the labs had been √¢¬Ä¬úunauthorized√¢¬Ä¬ù to handle the samples and therefore had to destroy them to comply with public health laws in the country. He stopped short of specifying how the samples were destroyed or why those labs had them in the first place.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been accusing China for months of destroying the samples to cover up the extent of the country√¢¬Ä¬ôs outbreak. Last month, he expressed frustration with the Chinese government for not sharing virus samples from within the country with the rest of the world √¢¬Ä¬ì something that makes it impossible to assess the evolution of the disease.

He has also accused the country of censoring coronavirus research and trying to influence international efforts to fight the disease. He criticized the country for taking too long to report the outbreak to the World Health Organization and said that even when they did notify them, they failed to share all of the information at their disposal.

Last week, he said: ‚ÄúThe Chinese Communist Party tried to suppress information about this virus, about where it began, about how it started, about how it was being transmitted from human to human, indeed employed the World Health Organization to further that storyline.‚Äù

The U.S. has been impacted disproportionately by the disease, with almost one quarter of the world√¢¬Ä¬ôs infections and deaths being seen in America. So far, more than 4.59 million people have tested positive for the disease globally and at least 309,000 have died according to official numbers √¢¬Ä¬ì although the real death toll is widely believed to be far higher.

President Trump has said he√¢¬Ä¬ôs √¢¬Ä¬úvery disappointed in China√¢¬Ä¬ù and that he has no desire to talk to Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Intelligence reports show China acted irresponsibly

A report from the department of Homeland Security shows that American officials believe that China intentionally covered up how severe the pandemic was in early January while hoarding medical supplies. Meanwhile, a leaked dossier by the Five Eyes intelligence alliance outlines how Beijing has caused some whistleblowers to mysteriously √¢¬Ä¬údisappear√¢¬Ä¬ù and scrubbed mentions of the disease in its early stages from the internet while destroying virus samples. They called their actions an √¢¬Ä¬úassault on international transparency.√¢¬Ä¬ù

Other intelligence agencies have reached similar findings. For example, Der Spiegel reported on a German intelligence document that suggests the Chinese president personally pressured the Director-General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, into holding back info about human-to-human transmission and delaying a pandemic warning.

In fact, Germany√¢¬Ä¬ôs Federal Intelligence Service estimated that China√¢¬Ä¬ôs actions √¢¬Ä¬úlost four to six weeks to fight the virus worldwide.√¢¬Ä¬ù

Is it any surprise that the majority of Americans view China negatively and have no confidence in President Xi?

We already knew that China destroyed those samples, so admitting to doing so and making up an excuse for it isn√¢¬Ä¬ôt going to do much to make them look any better. In fact, it will only add fuel to the rumors of coverups that are going on in the country, including those surrounding how this disease came into existence in the first place. If they were really so worried about √¢¬Ä¬úsafety,√¢¬Ä¬ù they would have acted far differently from the√Ç start of this pandemic, and thousands of people around the world who have died in the last few months might still be alive and with their loved ones today.

She says there are ‚Äúa few good candidates‚Äù for a vaccine and that the U.S. needs ‚Äúto start looking at a paid medical leave policy‚Äù to help workers on the front lines.

She also criticizes the Trump administration for its response to the crisis:

‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt had leadership at the national level ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs chaos.‚Äù

This while wearing a very odd looking upside-down inverted cross around her neck.

Melinda Gates in an interview on TODAY Show pushing hard for a global COVID-19 vaccine was wearing a bright and shiny upside-down cross around her neck.

Symbolism is very important to groups like the Illuminati, the New World Order and others, as they love to flash you signs of how much smarter they are than you and I are.

We are ruled by a satanic death cult who is obsessed with symbolism. Besides Melinda Gates‚Äô inverted cross, here‚Äôs 2 more examples of satanic symbolism related to the ‚ÄòGates of Hell‚Äô family and the upcoming ‚Äòmark of the beast‚Äô vaccine:

1. An Enzyme Called LUCIFERASE is What Makes Bill Gates Implantable Vaccine Work

2. Microsoft Funds ID2020 And Files Patent For Device Attached To The Human Body For Buying And Selling Bitcoin ‚Äì Patent #666

They like to put their true agenda right in our faces, and dare us to figure it out. Take a quick trip to our Predictive Programming section, and you will see immediately what we‚Äôre talking about.

All this brings us to an interview the TODAY Show did with Melinda Gates back on November 8th, where we see Melinda wearing an upside-down, or inverted, cross around her neck.

Who likes to wear inverted crosses? Satanists, pagans, witches, warlocks, New Agers, most people in Hollywood ‚Ä¶ you get the idea.

‚ÄúChrist hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:‚Äù Galatians 3:13 (KJB)

The early First Century Christians never used the cross as a sign or symbol for anything, why? Because it was the instrument of the torturous death of Jesus of Nazareth.

The cross as iconic symbolism would not appear until biblical Christianity was hijacked by the Romans around 325 AD. From that point on you see crosses on everything as Rome infused paganism with Christianity.

The bible tells us that the cross is the sign of a curse, and cursed people hang on them. No one in their right minds who believed the bible would want the sign of a curse hanging around their own necks, much less wearing an upside-down cross like the pagans / satanists do.

I will let you make up your own mind as to why Melinda Gates chose to wear an upside-down cross on national television.

I know she went to Catholic school, and that she and Bill have raised their children as Catholics.

But when you look at the millions of dollars they give to Planned Parenthood, an organization that exists to slaughter children in the womb, exactly what kind of Catholic she is gets a little murky, to say the least.

The Roman Catholic Church, what I like to call counterfeit Christianity, loves weird occult and pagan symbolism.

Over the years we‚Äôve shown you the Vatican Audience Hall that is shaped exactly like a giant snake, and has the freakiest, most nastiest-looking statue right behind here the pope sits. [It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that the pope‚Äôs throne has a massive inverted cross on it.]

Occult symbolism pervades the Vatican to a very high degree. Melinda Gates is a Catholic, you do the math.

The lethal illness first emerged late last year in the Chinese city of Wuhan, spreading across the country to infect some 84,000 people, killing in excess of 4,600. But with aggressive containment measures that put tens of millions of citizens under strict lockdown, Beijing appears to have largely brought the contagion under control, reporting a only slow trickle of new cases as the virus took hold elsewhere in the world.

While the United States remains the top epicenter with more than 1.6 million infections, South America has quickly overtaken other regions for the number-two spot, with the World Health Organization (WHO) warning of a dramatic spike in cases there.

‚ÄúIn a sense, South America has become a new epicenter for the disease,‚Äù Dr Mike Ryan, the WHO's top emergencies expert, told a press conference on Friday, noting that Brazil is ‚Äúclearly the most affected.‚Äù

Brazil has also counted more than 21,000 fatal cases, nearly seven times more than Peru, the region‚Äôs next hardest-hit country.

Though no vaccine, or even a reliable treatment, currently exists for the coronavirus, Brazilian authorities have approved widespread use of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a therapy, after receiving shipments of raw materials for the chemical from India last month. The drug has shown early promise as a treatment, but its effectiveness has yet to be proven in a clinical setting. A new study in the Lancet journal, meanwhile, suggests the medicine could cause heart complications and even death, showing little or no benefit to Covid-19 patients.

Since the pandemic broke out last December, more than 5.2 million people have been sickened and some 338,000 killed worldwide, making it one of the deadliest viral outbreaks since the 1918 Spanish Flu.

Moderna's chief financial officer Lorence Kim and chief medical officer Tal Zaks dumped the staggering value of stocks on Monday and Tuesday when the share price skyrocketed following the company's announcement of what it described as 'positive' results from its vaccine trial.

The two executives pocketed almost $25 million in profits in a day's work before experts cast doubt on the vaccine's success and sent shares tumbling.

Kim exercised 241,000 options for $3 million Monday, then instantly sold them for $19.8 million, taking a tidy profit of $16.8 million, SEC filings seen by CNN Business show.

On Tuesday, Zaks exercised $1.5 million stock options before making a profit of $8.2 million when he immediately offloaded them for $9.77 million.

Stocks in Moderna surged as much as 30 percent Monday to $87 a share, after it released promising results of its COVID-19 vaccine trial

Moderna's chief financial officer Lorence Kim (left) and chief medical officer Tal Zaks (right) dumped the staggering value of stocks on Monday and Tuesday when the share price skyrocketed following the company's announcement over its vaccine trial

The biotech company released results from its COVID-19 vaccine trial Monday, after it became the first US company to start a clinical trial for a vaccine back in March.

This sparked hope that a vaccine for the deadly virus could make it to market by January and sent Wall Street investors into overdrive.

Stocks in Moderna surged as much as 30 percent Monday to $87 a share, and the company's market value climbed to $29 billion.

While investors raced to get a slice of the firm, the two insiders CFO Kim and CMO Zaks dumped the near-$30 million of shares between them on Monday and Tuesday.

According to filings, Kim also offloaded stocks in the days before the results of the trial were announced, selling 20,000 shares worth $1.3 million on May 15.

The timing of the sales may appear suspicious but Moderna insisted this week's sales from the two insiders were executed under automated insider trading plans, known as 10b5-1 plans.

Such plans lay out future stock trades at set prices or on set dates, with transactions typically being carried out without the insiders taking any action.

'These transactions are executing automatically pursuant to these trading plans,' the company said.

Experts have said this means the deals are perfectly legal.

Andrew Gordon, director of research services at Equilar, told CNN Business the executives' actions would only pose a 'legal issue if they created or modified their 10b5-1 plan while in possession of material insider information.

'It's not uncommon for insiders to sell shares they own, nor is it bad for them to capitalize on the current stock price.'

The company's share price wavered more as the week went on as the medical community gave a mixed response to the apparent success of the vaccine trials.

The company's share price wavered more as the week went on as the medical community gave a mixed response to the success of the vaccine trials. Dr Fauci called the trials 'optimistic'

Health website Stat cast doubt on the vaccine Tuesday, saying not enough information was available to understand if the phase one trial was a success and sending shares down to $71.67 that day.

Shares fell further to a low of $67.05 Thursday, down 16 percent from its Monday close.

Other experts have also voiced their skepticism over the trials.

Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, told Nature.com he was 'not convinced' by Moderna's claims.

'I'm not convinced that this is really a positive result,' Hotez said.

Shares then went up again Friday to $68.60 after Dr Anthony Fauci, the federal government's top immunologist, said he was 'cautiously optimistic' about Moderna's vaccine.

'Although the numbers were limited, it was quite good news because it reached and went over an important hurdle in the development of vaccines. That's the reason why I'm cautiously optimistic about it,' Fauci said at a CNN town hall on Thursday.

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which Fauci is head of, is developing the vaccine in collaboration with Moderna.

Dr. Carlos del Rio, an Emory University professor of medicine which is testing Moderna's vaccine, echoed Fauci's optimism in an interview with CNBC Friday.

'I am cautiously optimistic. We are developing at a pace that has never been done before,' he said.

Moderna's phase one study of 45 participants and measuring the antibodies in eight participants found all eight had developed antibodies to the virus at levels at or above the antibodies found in people who have recovered from COVID-19

'Trying to think that, a year after a virus has been identified, we will have a vaccine ready to deploy and ready to go into massive distribution, it's simply mind-boggling to me.

'I have to be a little cautious and say I hope it happens, but I don't want to be - I want to make sure we do it the right way.'

Moderna's phase one study of 45 participants and measuring the antibodies in eight participants found all eight had developed antibodies to the virus at levels at or above the antibodies found in people who have recovered from COVID-19, the company revealed.

LOS ANGELES ‚Äî While some parts of the country are seeing major progress in fighting the coronavirus, Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House‚Äôs coronavirus response coordinator, on Friday singled out Los Angeles as one of three regions where persistent spread remains a significant concern.

Speaking with reporters at the White House, Birx gave a mostly upbeat assessment of the nation‚Äôs progress but said the Los Angeles metropolitan area, which includes Orange County, is continuing to see problems, along with Washington, D.C., and Chicago.

‚ÄúEven though Washington has remained closed, L.A. has remained closed, Chicago has remained closed, we still see these ongoing cases,‚Äù she said.

Brix asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to work with those areas ‚Äúto really understand where are these new cases coming from, and what do we need to do to prevent them in the future.‚Äù

Los Angeles County is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in California, accounting for about 56% of the state‚Äôs total deaths and almost half of nearly 90,000 confirmed infections. The county‚Äôs death toll rose Thursday to 2,021, with more than 42,000 confirmed cases.

‚ÄúThis is a very sad milestone for us,‚Äù county Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Thursday after the deaths exceeded 2,000.

Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis said she hoped officials could ease stay-at-home restrictions soon but urged caution.

‚ÄúI wish that we could speed things up,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe virus is still out there waiting for us to let our guard down.‚Äù

Despite the average daily death toll, which has remained at a stubborn plateau for weeks, there were new signs that even Los Angeles is beginning to turn the corner.

The coronavirus transmission rate in the nation‚Äôs most populous county is now in its best position since the magnitude of the outbreak became clear in March.

Still, officials remain concerned that warm temperatures and quarantine fatigue could drive people from their homes over the Memorial Day weekend, resulting in crowding at parks and beaches that could threaten to undo some of the progress the state has made.

In San Francisco, the parks department painted 10-foot circles on the grass of four city parks ahead of the holiday weekend to remind visitors to follow social distancing rules.

It‚Äôs part of a pilot program based on a similar effort at Domino Park in Brooklyn, said Tamara Barak Aparton, spokeswoman for San Francisco Recreation and Parks.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be warm this weekend and we knew people would be out, so we thought it would be a good time to get feedback on whether this helps,‚Äù Aparton said. If successful, the circles could be expanded to more locations, she said.

In Orange County, several coastal cities expanded their beach hours and planned to open more parking lots connected to the shoreline ahead of the holiday.

Seal Beach, which initially allowed public access only Mondays through Thursdays from sunrise to sunset, is now welcoming beachgoers from 4:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week, officials said earlier this week. Some beach parking lots also reopened. Beaches are open for active use only.

A few miles south, Huntington Beach and Newport Beach also are allowing beach access on weekends, ahead of the Memorial Day holiday. Newport is now open 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., while Huntington Beach opens an hour earlier.

Laguna Beach, however, is maintaining stricter hours on Saturdays and Sundays, with its coastline closing at noon each day.

While Los Angeles County beaches also have reopened for active use, only some parking lots are open.

In addition to the reduced transmission rate, L.A. County has seen other encouraging indicators, including a 12% decrease in its latest seven-day average of deaths per day and a 15% decrease in its most recent three-day average for hospitalizations per day, Ferrer said Thursday.

‚ÄúThe progress we‚Äôve made in slowing the spread, the reduction in the average daily deaths and hospitalizations and retaining capacity in our health care system ‚Äî this lets us know that the extraordinary efforts and sacrifices made by all of you are working,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAs a community, we‚Äôve done this together, and this progress is a direct reflection of what all of you in your day-to-day lives have been able to accomplish.‚Äù

Still, she said, officials will continue to keep a close eye on those metrics to ensure they don‚Äôt creep up as more people are out in the public due to businesses and recreation areas reopening.

‚ÄúThrough our recovery journey, as we‚Äôre all out of our homes more, it may become more difficult to slow the spread, but it is far from impossible,‚Äù she said.

Though experts say it‚Äôs still too soon for L.A. County to move into a more aggressive phase of recovery, much of California has progressed to a point where officials feel it‚Äôs safe to lift more of the state‚Äôs stay-at-home order and allow more businesses to reopen.

The number of new coronavirus cases across the state declined from the previous week, and hospitalizations have dropped more than 15% from a peak six weeks ago, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis.

Most counties have received approval to progress more quickly through Phase 2 of the state‚Äôs reopening road map ‚Äî meaning they can open restaurant dining rooms and more retail businesses for in-store shopping.

The list of counties that can ramp up their reopening efforts now includes San Diego ‚Äî the state‚Äôs second-most populous ‚Äî Kern, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura.

That comes as officials revealed that California‚Äôs unemployment rate nearly tripled from mid-March to mid-April, with the state losing an unprecedented 2.3 million payroll jobs across all sectors of its economy as a result of the pandemic.

April‚Äôs jobless rate skyrocketed to 15.5%, up from 5.5% a month before, sweeping past the Great Recession‚Äôs peak of 12.3% a decade ago, state officials reported Friday.

The Golden State‚Äôs jobless rate is higher than the nationwide rate of 14.7%, reflecting California‚Äôs reliance on tourism, hospitality and entertainment businesses.

Still, some local officials are urging tourists to stay away ‚Äî at least for now. Multiple counties have expressed concern about people visiting and possibly bringing with them the coronavirus, especially during the Memorial Day weekend.

Dr. Penny Borenstein, San Luis Obispo County‚Äôs health officer, asked tourists to not visit as the county reopened many shops and restaurants this week. While officials have performed ‚Äúspot checks‚Äù with hotels to deter tourism, Borenstein said the county would cite visitors only in the case of ‚Äúegregious violations.‚Äù

Remote Alpine County urged tourists to stay away when the virus began to spread through California in March.

Dr. Richard Johnson, the Alpine County public health officer, said last month there‚Äôs no medical care to treat visitors who fall ill with COVID-19.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way we would even have ground or air resources to get them out,‚Äù Johnson said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a dangerous assumption that you can come and look at us as a safe haven. It is an unsafe haven.‚Äù

Communities in the Lake Tahoe region, which heavily depend on tourism as well, have issued reminders before the holiday weekend warning that leisure travel is not permitted.

On its website, the city of South Lake Tahoe said that while second homeowners are now welcome, other visitors are still not. Lodging will not be available to short-term renters.

‚ÄúWe would love nothing more than to welcome everyone to Tahoe right now, but that‚Äôs not the safest way to bring people back to South Lake,‚Äù City Manager Joe Irvin said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe need to be responsible and make sure we are doing our part to keep our neighbors safe and Tahoe safe while adhering to the governor‚Äôs stay at home orders.‚Äù

LOS ANGELES ‚Äî While some parts of the country are seeing major progress in fighting the coronavirus, Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House‚Äôs coronavirus response coordinator, on Friday singled out Los Angeles as one of three regions where persistent spread remains a significant concern.  Speaking with reporters at the White House, Birx gave a mostly upbeat assessment of the nation‚Äôs progress but said the Los Angeles metropolitan area, which includes Orange County, is continuing to see problems, along with Washington, D.C., and Chicago.  ‚ÄúEven though Washington has remained closed, L.A. has remained closed, Chicago has remained closed, we still see these ongoing cases,‚Äù she said.  Brix asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to work with those areas ‚Äúto really understand where are these new cases coming from, and what do we need to do to prevent them in the future.‚Äù  Los Angeles County is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in California, accounting for about 56% of the state‚Äôs total deaths and almost half of nearly 90,000 confirmed infections. The county‚Äôs death toll rose Thursday to 2,021, with more than 42,000 confirmed cases.  ‚ÄúThis is a very sad milestone for us,‚Äù county Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Thursday after the deaths exceeded 2,000.  Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis said she hoped officials could ease stay-at-home restrictions soon but urged caution.  ‚ÄúI wish that we could speed things up,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe virus is still out there waiting for us to let our guard down.‚Äù  Despite the average daily death toll, which has remained at a stubborn plateau for weeks, there were new signs that even Los Angeles is beginning to turn the corner.  The coronavirus transmission rate in the nation‚Äôs most populous county is now in its best position since the magnitude of the outbreak became clear in March.  Still, officials remain concerned that warm temperatures and quarantine fatigue could drive people from their homes over the Memorial Day weekend, resulting in crowding at parks and beaches that could threaten to undo some of the progress the state has made.  In San Francisco, the parks department painted 10-foot circles on the grass of four city parks ahead of the holiday weekend to remind visitors to follow social distancing rules.  It‚Äôs part of a pilot program based on a similar effort at Domino Park in Brooklyn, said Tamara Barak Aparton, spokeswoman for San Francisco Recreation and Parks.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be warm this weekend and we knew people would be out, so we thought it would be a good time to get feedback on whether this helps,‚Äù Aparton said.

There is a dire need for financial support of healthcare providers and facilities as they continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, now affecting the United States the most drastically. In response, the President signed the bipartisan CARES Act on March 27, 2020, providing much-needed relief funds to hospitals and other healthcare providers on the frontlines of the fight against coronavirus. As part of the recently announced CARES Act, $100 billion will be appropriated to create a Public Health Social Service Emergency Fund with an ultimate goal of preventing, preparing for, and responding to the coronavirus outbreak both domestically and on an international scale.

Per the Act, funding will be dedicated to reimbursing healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 to alleviate some of the financial burden many providers are experiencing. Part of this relief payment will focus on ensuring that uninsured Americans have access to testing and treatment, and that medical professionals providing the care are reimbursed for their work. The Department of Health and Human Services has published detailed criteria for the process of distribution of funds under the Act as well as information about eligibility requirements, outlined below.

Immediate Relief Funding

Recognizing the urgent need for the delivery of financial relief, the HHS immediately infused $30 billion into the American healthcare system. Payments are slated to arrive via direct deposit beginning April 10, 2020 to eligible providers throughout the system. Note, these are direct payments, not loans and will not need to be repaid, the HHS emphasizes.

Eligibility for Immediate Relief Payments

Per guidance from the HHS, all facilities and providers that received Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) reimbursements in 2019 are eligible to receive payments from this initial rapid distribution. Payments to practices that are part of larger medical groups will be sent to the group‚Äôs central billing office, while all relief payments will be made to the billing organization according to its Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).

In order to be eligible to receive these funds, providers must not seek to collect of out-of-pocket payments from a COVID-19 patient that are greater than what they would be otherwise had the care been provided by an in-network practitioner. If a practice had to halt business operations as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, providers may still be eligible to receive funds if they provided diagnoses, testing, or care for patients with possible or confirmed cases of COVID-19. Per the HHS, ‚ÄúCare does not have to be specific to treating COVID-19. HHS broadly views every patient as a possible case of COVID-19.‚Äù

The immediate relief payments hope to alleviate providers in hard-hit COVID-19 areas and those who are struggling to keep their practice open due to delayed care and widespread cancellations of elective procedures.

Payment Distributions

Payment distributions will be based on the provider‚Äôs or practice‚Äôs share of total Medicare FFS reimbursements for the year 2019; that year, the total FFS payments were approximately $484 billion. Providers can estimate their anticipated payment by dividing their 2019 Medicare FFS (excluding Medicare Advantage) payments ‚Äì which can be obtained from their organization‚Äôs revenue management system ‚Äì by $484 billion and multiplying that ratio by $30 billion.

Receiving Payments

In partnership with UnitedHealth Group (UHG), the HHS will provide rapid payments to eligible providers, as described above, to distribute the initial round of funding. Providers will be paid via their Automated Clearing House account information on file with UHG or the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and can expect to receive payments via Optum Bank with ‚ÄúHHSPAYMENT‚Äù as the payment description. Providers who receive reimbursements from CMS via paper check can expect to receive a paper check in the mail within the next few weeks.

Providers must sign an attestation confirming receipt of the funds and agreeing to the terms and conditions of payment within 30 days of receipt. The Terms and Conditions of the funding can be found on the CMS website. If the payment is not returned within 30 days, the HHS will view this as an acceptance of the Terms and Conditions. However, if a provider does not wish to comply with the Terms and Conditions, they must contact HHS within 30 days of receipt of payment and then return the full payment to HHS.

Different Types of Providers

All relief payments are being made to providers according to their tax identification number (TIN). Large organizations will receive payments for each of their billing TINs that bill Medicare, and should look to the part of their organization that handles Medicare billing to identify details on Medicare payments for 2019. Employed physicians should not expect to receive an individual payment directly; instead, their employer‚Äôs organization will receive the relief payment as the billing organization. Similarly, individual physicians and providers in a group practice are unlikely to receive individual payments directly; the group practice will receive the relief fund payment as the billing organization. Solo practitioners who bill Medicare will receive a payment under the TIN they use to bill Medicare.

The Remaining $70 Billion

As part of the $100 billion guaranteed by the CARES Act, the remaining $70 billion will be comprised of targeted distributions focused on providers in areas particularly impacted by the virus, rural providers, providers of services with lower shares of Medicare reimbursement or who predominantly serve the Medicaid population, as well as providers requesting reimbursement for the treatment of uninsured Americans. More guidance is expected on the structure of these payments in the coming weeks.

COVID-19 Medical Expenses

The federal government is taking measures to ensure Americans are not surprised by medical expenses and are protected against financial obstacles that might prevent them from seeking care or getting tested and treated for COVID-19. A portion of the Provider Relief Fund will be used to reimburse healthcare providers at Medicare rates for COVID-related treatment of the uninsured. However, providers are prohibited from ‚Äúbalance billing‚Äù any patient for COVID-related treatment in order to be eligible.

In addition, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act requires private insurers to cover an insurance plan member‚Äôs cost-sharing payments for COVID-19 testing. Further, the government has secured commitments from private insurers ‚Äì such as Humana, Cigna, UnitedHealthGroup, and the Blue Cross Blue Shield system ‚Äì to waive cost-sharing payments for treatment related to COVID-19 for its members and make medical care more accessible.

Heavily anticipated by providers across the nation, the latest guidance helps to clarify eligibility, distribution, and payment concerns regarding the Provider Relief Fund. Eligible practices and providers may soon expect to receive payments from the immediate round of funding.

Viruses have been with us since the dawn of man. An estimated 380 trillion viruses can infect the human body at any one time. (1) Human biology is exquisitely tuned to defeat viruses or to coexist with viruses as part of the human viome. Our relationship with microbes is vibrant and sometimes a fight for one-upmanship. (2) Our existence is a testament to our ability to manage viral loads.

The pharmacopeias of the world, of some 500,000 different drugs, contain long lists of substances which have antiviral, antibiotic and immune boosting substances. This list alone of antiviral drugs (3) is impressive. It is almost certain that within the realm of the worldwide knowledge of substances, that some would exist which would counter the threat of the coronavirus and any other virus that overwhelms us.

Given the threat of global viral pandemics, how can the whole of the world‚Äôs medical and scientific communities not be mobilized and galvanized? Is it beyond the world‚Äôs governments to open the door of their various warehouses to find an antidote to the coronavirus which is now strongly suspected to have been developed as a bioweapon? If this is the case, it is almost a certainty that there are multiple antiviral agents already at hand to control this plague.

But, for a moment, let‚Äôs assume the opposite. That this coronavirus is a previously unseen natural biological agent created by Mother Nature on her worst day. The sum of the world‚Äôs scientific and academic brain power should still have the means to undo this clever virus.

A virus is a little thing with very few operating parts and no immune system of its own and no ability to reproduce on its own. The entire animal world including humans cannot have existed thus far without the knowledge and the means to overcome not only the coronavirus, but all virus pathogens whether bioengineered or not, collectively, can and do the governments of the world deliberately keep information from us? Some reporters are noting that the top virologists and microbiologists in the world are mysteriously dying or disappearing, to the toll of over 100 and counting. (4)(5) Why?

These are urgent times. The reality is that we have the ability, mindpower, and manpower. What we don‚Äôt have is the approbation of the powers that be. Doctors are not allowed to be doctors. Scientists are handcuffed into belief systems that must have authority approval. The coronavirus pandemic has been projected to kill as many as 65 million people (6). If projections hold true, this is a time that requires great courage to step out and tap into our incredible human resources. Some world leaders have called for a population reduction by at least 15% and some as high as 90%. (7)

Those who have become physicians must step up and act as the healers and leaders that they intended to be. We are now in a situation that demands a higher calling. Step up and do what you know to be right for yourself and humanity, there may not be a next chance if you do not.

Following is a short list of available therapies which can have a positive impact on quelling a pandemic. Some therapies should be used right away to make sure that your immune system is in order. Some should be used at the first sign of illness for speedy recovery. Finally, some will be offered for cytokine storms. The immune system overreacts to the infection, and the resulting inflammation overwhelms the body. Cytokine storms can lead to sepsis (infection carried in the blood stream leading to organ collapse) which is often fatal. However, there have been successful interventions for sepsis and the preceding pneumonia.

There are well documented and proven interventions that have been reported in clinical literature again and again over the past 100 years - you must not ignore the solutions on hand while waiting for officially approved new proprietary drugs while people are dying.

Ionic Solutions and Colloids of Silver and Copper

Before antibiotics, silver was the antibiotic of choice. Silver solutions can be prepared to drink on a regular basis as preventative or used to treat. Silver solutions can be used in neti pots for the nose or simply used as a nasal spray. In extreme cases, silver has been used as an intravenous treatment. (8). Copper solutions can be used to disinfect surfaces.(9)

Ozone

Ozone is a gas which quickly converts into oxygen which can treat any infection. It can be added to water to drink, used to clean produce and surfaces. It can be used in therapy in the ears, vaginally and rectally. It is too irritating to the lungs to inhale unless bubbled through an oil first. Ozonated oils can be used on the skin. The American Association of Ozone Therapy (AOT) website provides information and a physician referral. A trained practitioner is needed for ozone to be used intravenously. (10) Dr. Robert Rowen teaches ozone therapies to train practitioners. He traveled to Sri Lanka to treat Ebola with ozone injected directly. (11) Before being impeded by an authoritative government, he was able to demonstrate recovery from Ebola with ozone. He pioneered doing an intravenous therapy using 10 passes of ozone. This can be used for the most resistant of infections.

Oxygen/Hyperbaric Oxygen/Hydrogen peroxide

Oxygen can be delivered in other forms to deal with infections. At the first sign of respiratory distress in hospitals, patients are given oxygen to breathe. Home units of oxygen concentrators can be used to improve oxygenation. Hyperbaric chambers supply extra oxygen to the whole body at pressure. Tissue oxygenation happens while bypassing the lungs. When hydrogen peroxide bubbles, water and oxygen are released yielding its disinfectant qualities. Hydrogen peroxide can clean surfaces, and it can be used in the ears and gargled diluted in water at the first sign of a cold or flu. Hydrogen peroxide is also used medically intravenously and provides increased oxygen levels for the body.

Hydrochloric Acid, Hydrogen

There is a book documenting the incredible effects of hydrochloric acid (HCl). ‚ÄúThree Years of Hydrochloric Acid Therapy‚Äù which can be viewed by clicking here. Hydrochloric acid is used both intramuscularly and intravenously and provides an immune system boost. Molecular hydrogen ions or hydrogen gas can be used therapeutically to quell oxidative stress. The science behind hydrogen is compiled at the Molecular Hydrogen Institute. (12)

Intravenous and Oral Vitamin C

Vitamin C is available to use orally and has been ever since Dr. Linus Pauling demonstrated its antiviral effects. To use orally, instructions are to use vitamin C in frequent dosing to the point of getting diarrhea and then backing down but not stopping and continuing till resolved. Vitamin C can be taken daily for maintenance. Dr. Pauling himself used about 30 gm of vitamin C daily. (13) 60 Minutes aired a segment on the miraculous recovery of a New Zealand man who was given intravenous vitamin C and recovered quickly from a viral infection after doctors had recommended that the family stop all life support, and death would ensue in 1-2 days. Normally, you would think that this would shake the medical communities of the world to action to provide intravenous vitamin C for all critical infections. Intravenous vitamin C is a mainstay in functional medicine but is not to be found in our hospitals. Search out providers ahead of time in case this modality is needed.(14) Dr. Fred Klenner used both intramuscular vitamin C and intravenous vitamin C for numerous viral infections including polio successfully.

Ultraviolet Blood Irradiation or Photo Luminescence

Exposing the blood to the ultraviolet spectrum of light was developed in the 1920‚Äôs and also suffered a fate like Dr. Fred Klenner‚Äôs treatments for virus infections. This time it was the advent of penicillin that became the favored treatment. In this approach only a small amount of blood is removed and exposed to light in the ultraviolet range, then the blood is returned to the body. Then there is a profound increase in oxygen, and blood immune components are improved dramatically. This treatment can be used to quell the dangerous cytokine storms and rescue patients from sepsis. The equipment and supplies are very inexpensive and treatment time is just minutes. There are practitioners who still use this therapy in their practices.(16) (17)

This article highlights some of the opportunities that can and should be implemented in managing a pandemic. Effective treatments have already been developed and abandoned, sometimes for less effective treatments. Some of these are do it yourself solutions, and most need the intervention of a skilled practitioner. Be prepared by learning where and how these therapies can be readily accessed.

This discussion will be continued.",,USA,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,Don‚Äôt Die From The Flu,"Article courtesy of: Carol Petersen, RPh, CNP  Viruses have been with us since the dawn of man. An estimated 380 trillion viruses can infect the human body at any one time. (1) Human biology is exquisitely tuned to defeat viruses or to coexist with viruses as part of the human viome. Our relationship with microbes is vibrant and sometimes a fight for one-upmanship. (2) Our existence is a testament to our ability to manage viral loads.  The pharmacopeias of the world, of some 500,000 different drugs, contain long lists of substances which have antiviral, antibiotic and immune boosting substances. This list alone of antiviral drugs (3) is impressive. It is almost certain that within the realm of the worldwide knowledge of substances, that some would exist which would counter the threat of the coronavirus and any other virus that overwhelms us.  Given the threat of global viral pandemics, how can the whole of the world‚Äôs medical and scientific communities not be mobilized and galvanized? Is it beyond the world‚Äôs governments to open the door of their various warehouses to find an antidote to the coronavirus which is now strongly suspected to have been developed as a bioweapon? If this is the case, it is almost a certainty that there are multiple antiviral agents already at hand to control this plague.  But, for a moment, let‚Äôs assume the opposite. That this coronavirus is a previously unseen natural biological agent created by Mother Nature on her worst day. The sum of the world‚Äôs scientific and academic brain power should still have the means to undo this clever virus.  A virus is a little thing with very few operating parts and no immune system of its own and no ability to reproduce on its own. The entire animal world including humans cannot have existed thus far without the knowledge and the means to overcome not only the coronavirus, but all virus pathogens whether bioengineered or not, collectively, can and do the governments of the world deliberately keep information from us? Some reporters are noting that the top virologists and microbiologists in the world are mysteriously dying or disappearing, to the toll of over 100 and counting. (4)(5) Why?  These are urgent times. The reality is that we have the ability, mindpower, and manpower. What we don‚Äôt have is the approbation of the powers that be. Doctors are not allowed to be doctors. Scientists are handcuffed into belief systems that must have authority approval. The coronavirus pandemic has been projected to kill as many as 65 million people (6). If projections hold true, this is a time that requires great courage to step out and tap into our incredible human resources. Some world leaders have called for a population reduction by at least 15% and some as high as 90%. (7)  Those who have become physicians must step up and act as the healers and leaders that they intended to be. We are now in a situation that demands a higher calling. Step up and do what you know to be right for yourself and humanity, there may not be a next chance if you do not.  Following is a short list of available therapies which can have a positive impact on quelling a pandemic. Some therapies should be used right away to make sure that your immune system is in order. Some should be used at the first sign of illness for speedy recovery. Finally, some will be offered for cytokine storms. The immune system overreacts to the infection, and the resulting inflammation overwhelms the body. Cytokine storms can lead to sepsis (infection carried in the blood stream leading to organ collapse) which is often fatal. However, there have been successful interventions for sepsis and the preceding pneumonia.  There are well documented and proven interventions that have been reported in clinical literature again and again over the past 100 years - you must not ignore the solutions on hand while waiting for officially approved new proprietary drugs while people are dying.  Ionic Solutions and Colloids of Silver and Copper  Before antibiotics, silver was the antibiotic of choice. Silver solutions can be prepared to drink on a regular basis as preventative or used to treat. Silver solutions can be used in neti pots for the nose or simply used as a nasal spray. In extreme cases, silver has been used as an intravenous treatment. (8). Copper solutions can be used to disinfect surfaces.(9)  Ozone  Ozone is a gas which quickly converts into oxygen which can treat any infection. It can be added to water to drink, used to clean produce and surfaces. It can be used in therapy in the ears, vaginally and rectally. It is too irritating to the lungs to inhale unless bubbled through an oil first. Ozonated oils can be used on the skin. The American Association of Ozone Therapy (AOT) website provides information and a physician referral. A trained practitioner is needed for ozone to be used intravenously. (10) Dr. Robert Rowen teaches ozone therapies to train practitioners. He traveled to Sri Lanka to treat Ebola with ozone injected directly. (11) Before being impeded by an authoritative government, he was able to demonstrate recovery from Ebola with ozone. He pioneered doing an intravenous therapy using 10 passes of ozone. This can be used for the most resistant of infections.  Oxygen/Hyperbaric Oxygen/Hydrogen peroxide  Oxygen can be delivered in other forms to deal with infections. At the first sign of respiratory distress in hospitals, patients are given oxygen to breathe. Home units of oxygen concentrators can be used to improve oxygenation. Hyperbaric chambers supply extra oxygen to the whole body at pressure. Tissue oxygenation happens while bypassing the lungs. When hydrogen peroxide bubbles, water and oxygen are released yielding its disinfectant qualities. Hydrogen peroxide can clean surfaces, and it can be used in the ears and gargled diluted in water at the first sign of a cold or flu. Hydrogen peroxide is also used medically intravenously and provides increased oxygen levels for the body.  Hydrochloric Acid, Hydrogen  There is a book documenting the incredible effects of hydrochloric acid (HCl). ‚ÄúThree Years of Hydrochloric Acid Therapy‚Äù which can be viewed by clicking here. Hydrochloric acid is used both intramuscularly and intravenously and provides an immune system boost. Molecular hydrogen ions or hydrogen gas can be used therapeutically to quell oxidative stress. The science behind hydrogen is compiled at the Molecular Hydrogen Institute. (12)  Intravenous and Oral Vitamin C  Vitamin C is available to use orally and has been ever since Dr. Linus Pauling demonstrated its antiviral effects. To use orally, instructions are to use vitamin C in frequent dosing to the point of getting diarrhea and then backing down but not stopping and continuing till resolved. Vitamin C can be taken daily for maintenance. Dr. Pauling himself used about 30 gm of vitamin C daily. (13) 60 Minutes aired a segment on the miraculous recovery of a New Zealand man who was given intravenous vitamin C and recovered quickly from a viral infection after doctors had recommended that the family stop all life support, and death would ensue in 1-2 days. Normally, you would think that this would shake the medical communities of the world to action to provide intravenous vitamin C for all critical infections. Intravenous vitamin C is a mainstay in functional medicine but is not to be found in our hospitals. Search out providers ahead of time in case this modality is needed.(14) Dr. Fred Klenner used both intramuscular vitamin C and intravenous vitamin C for numerous viral infections including polio successfully. However, his groundbreaking work was ignored in favor of the promotion of a vaccine program. (15)  Ultraviolet Blood Irradiation or Photo Luminescence  Exposing the blood to the ultraviolet spectrum of light was developed in the 1920‚Äôs and also suffered a fate like Dr. Fred Klenner‚Äôs treatments for virus infections.

But a practical consequence of such denial-mentality is America will lose the ‚Äúwar‚Äù against COVID-19.

On the occasion marking the 75th anniversary of victory over the Nazi Third Reich, the Trump White House made no mention of the Soviet Union‚Äôs indisputable military achievement of vanquishing the German fascist regime, instead implying that the US and Britain were the sole victors.

Trump added for vainglorious good measure: ‚ÄúThe American spirit will always win. In the end, that‚Äôs what happens.‚Äù

This outrageous falsification of history takes American absurdity to a whole new exceptional level. There has always been a cloying tendency in US popular culture to overstate the role played by America in defeating Nazi Germany. Hollywood films like ‚ÄòSaving Private Ryan‚Äô are unbearable to watch for their vanity and self-regarding Americanism.

But for Trump and his White House to openly claim it was Britain and America that won World War Two without even mentioning the colossal sacrifice of the Soviet Union, really takes the distortion and denial of reality into unchartered territory.

For three years, 1941-44, the Soviet Red Army fought the Nazi Wehrmacht single-handedly. The British and American opening of the Western front with their Normandy landings in June 1944 came as the Nazi regime was crumbling from sustained Soviet counter-offensive and epic battles. Six million Nazi troops were killed in the Eastern Front, compared with one million on the Western Front. The Red Army defeated the elite SS divisions paving the way for the Soviet routing of Hitler‚Äôs bunker ‚Äì the Third Reich‚Äôs last stand ‚Äì in Berlin.

As many as 27 million Soviet citizens died in the heroic war against Nazi Germany, including up to eight million Red Army soldiers. By contrast, the Americans and British each lost less than half a million troops.

Trump‚Äôs contemptible ignorance is matched by his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who also used the 75th anniversary to distort the liberation of Europe by the Red Army from Nazi Germany as supposedly leading to a tyrannical occupation by Soviet communism in the postwar decades.

This kind of delusional thinking is not just risible and repugnant. It has practical consequences which can be ruinous. For if the Trump administration can be so disconnected from reality, then its policy choices on other matters will be likewise absurd and dangerous.

Take the administration‚Äôs policy of blaming China for the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump and his officials are accusing China for ‚Äúcovering up‚Äù and even inflicting the virus on the US. This ‚Äúlogic‚Äù is based on fantastic, unscientific myths, which is creating a dangerous slippery-slope towards confrontation.

By pushing China for financial reparations over Covid-19 deaths and economic damage in the US, Trump is in denial over his administration‚Äôs abject failings to contend with the epidemic. But so desperate is Trump‚Äôs denial of reality, he is talking up an anti-China rationale that inevitably could lead to war.

The same goes for America‚Äôs chances of successful recovery from the pandemic. Trump is goading his nation to reopen the economy pretending that it is safe to do so without adequate testing and protections. Of course, this president views complex public health issues through the grubby lens of making financial profit.

While he is urging his country to reopen ‚Äì in the pretense that the ‚ÄúAmerican spirit will always win‚Äù ‚Äì Trump is ignoring the reality that his own White House has become a hotspot for Covid-19 infection. Three of the administration‚Äôs top health experts are in quarantine due to infection fears. Vice President Mike Pence is reportedly self-isolating after his press secretary tested positive for the disease. A valet to Trump has also been infected.

Kevin Hassett, an economic advisor to Trump, told US media at the weekend that the White House West Wing has become a ‚Äúscary place to work‚Äù ‚Äì such is the increasing risk of administration staffers succumbing to COVID-19.

Trump has previously likened the fight against the disease to a war. He incessantly congratulates himself for handling the epidemic which last week he compared to the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

This president is a walking contradiction from his own delusions and absurdities. He may be right about the ‚ÄúRussiagate"" nonsense and a lot of the ‚Äúfake news‚Äù US corporate news media. We can give him credit on that score.

1824,1824,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-22-washington-state-loses-millions-to-nigerian-unemployment-fraud.html,Natural News,22/05/2020,['Franz Walker'],Washington state loses hundreds of millions to Nigerian unemployment claims fraud,https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2020/05/Hacker-Scam-Hack-Phishing-Internet-Web-Stolen.jpg,"(Natural News) Officials in the state of Washington have acknowledged the loss of √¢¬Ä¬úhundreds of millions of dollars√¢¬Ä¬ù to an international scheme that hammered the state‚Äôs unemployment insurance system. The attack, which is thought to have originated in Nigeria, could mean even longer delays for thousands of unemployed workers still waiting for legitimate benefits.

The staggering losses were disclosed by Washington state Employment Security Department (ESD) Commissioner Suzi LeVine during a news conference Thursday afternoon. LeVine declined to specify exactly how much money was stolen during the scam. She conceded, however, that the amount was √¢¬Ä¬úorders of magnitude above the $1.6 million that the ESD reported as having lost to fraud in April.

Fraud comes and unemployment claims went down in other states

According to LeVine, state and law enforcement officials were working to recover as much of the money as possible, though she declined to mention how much had been recovered so far. She also said that the ESD had taken √¢¬Ä¬úa number of steps√¢¬Ä¬ù to prevent further fraudulent claims from being filed or paid, but did not specify the steps, to avoid tipping off criminals.

√¢¬Ä¬úWe do have definitive proof that the countermeasures we have put in place are working,√¢¬Ä¬ù LeVine said. √¢¬Ä¬úWe have successfully prevented hundreds of millions of additional dollars from going out to these criminals and prevented thousands of fraudulent claims from being filed.√¢¬Ä¬ù

LeVine‚Äôs disclosure, which came after state officials initially refused to discuss the scale of the fraud, helped explain the unusual surge in new unemployment claims filed in Washington state last week. For the week ending May 16, the ESD received 138,733 initial unemployment insurance claims, representing a 26.8 percent increase over the previous week and one of the biggest weekly surges since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. (Related:√Ç Coronavirus pushes√Ç unemployment√Ç to highest levels since the Great Depression.)

The surge in claims came as the number of initial claims for unemployment insurance nationwide fell 9.2 percent, to 2.4 million, according to data released earlier in the day by the√Ç Department of Labor.

Thanks to the sudden increase in claims, Washington became the state with the highest percentage of its civilian labor force filing unemployment claims ‚Äî at 30.8 percent according to an analysis by nonpartisan Washington, D.C., think tank the Tax Foundation. The next highest state, Nevada, reported claims from 24.5 percent of its workforce.

The disclosures also raised new questions about what, if anything, the ESD could have done to detect and protect its system from the attack.

Last week, the√Ç United States Secret Service had already issued an alert warning that Washington was the primary target of a √¢¬Ä¬úwell-organized Nigerian fraud ring exploiting the COVID-19 crisis to commit large-scale fraud against state unemployment insurance programs.√¢¬Ä¬ù The alert also noted that there was evidence of attacks on other states such as Florida, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island and Wyoming, warning of √¢¬Ä¬úpotential losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars.√¢¬Ä¬ù

Nigerian fraud ring implicated

Among the√Ç criminal groups involved in the attack is a Nigerian organization known as Scattered Canary, based on a report released this week by California-based cybersecurity firm Agari, who has been tracking the organization‚Äôs activities for some time now. According to the report, the group has been running various scams for over a decade now, working to steal Social Security payments, disaster relief funds and student aid, among others.

The Nigerian group likely used personal information about Washingtonians taken from previous consumer-data breaches to file bogus claims in the state‚Äôs unemployment system. These were then paid out alongside hundreds of thousands of legitimate ones.

√¢¬Ä¬úThese crime rings are indiscriminate and very quick to jump on an opportunity,√¢¬Ä¬ù said Armen Najarian, chief identity officer for Agari, in an interview.

ESD officials have claimed that the group targetted Washington because it was one of the first states to begin paying out new benefits available under the $2.2 trillion federal stimulus bill.√Ç While this legislation boosted benefits available under existing state unemployment insurance systems, it also gave state officials less time to verify new claims for those benefits.

According to ESD officials, the elimination of the so-called √¢¬Ä¬úwaiting week√¢¬Ä¬ù between the time a claim is filed and the time the benefit is paid meant that the agency wasn‚Äôt always able to get proper verification from employers about a claim before payment was made.

In addition, since federal benefits were technically available√Ç beginning in March, weeks before the state was able to upgrade its system to be able to pay them, many claimants had retroactive claims waiting to be paid in the ESD‚Äôs system.

At the federal level, the attack is being investigated by the inspector generals of the√Ç Social Security Administration and the√Ç Department of Labor; the√Ç United States Secret Service; and the√Ç Federal Bureau of Investigation, under the coordination of the office of U.S. Attorney Brian T. Moran in√Ç Seattle.

On Thursday, Moran said that federal officials worked with a √¢¬Ä¬údiligent financial institution√¢¬Ä¬ù to√Ç stop√Ç √¢¬Ä¬ú$120 million from being distributed to criminals,√¢¬Ä¬ù and were √¢¬Ä¬úassisting in recovering millions of additional dollars, with assistance from scores of other banks and credit unions.√¢¬Ä¬ù

No word if she threw the binder at the staffers.

Senator Klobuchar(D-MN) is officially going through the ‚Äúinvasive‚Äù vetting process as a potential running mate for Joe Biden.

Klobuchar is just the latest in the list of candidates being floated.

CBS News broke the story yesterday.

Trending: After ‚ÄòSuffering In Hell‚Äô During His COVID Treatment Coma, Drummer Rejects Satanic Beliefs The request for information from potential running mates like Klobuchar ‚Äúis underway,‚Äù a senior Biden campaign aide tells CBS News. If a potential contender consents, she should be poised to undergo a rigorous multi-week review of her public and private life and work by a hand-picked group of Biden confidantes, who will review tax returns, public speeches, voting records, past personal relationships and potentially scandalous details from her past‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶Biden has publicly credited Klobuchar for strong debate performances and for helping him win Minnesota, a victory that came only after she and other contenders dropped out just hours before March‚Äôs Super Tuesday primaries that helped propel Biden into the lead. He is on track to officially clinch the Democratic presidential nomination next month after several states hold primaries rescheduled because of the coronavirus pandemic‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶‚ÄùI need someone who‚Äôs going to be, as Barack said, ‚Äòsimpatico with me,‚Äô who is a real partner in progress and is ready to be president on a moment‚Äôs notice,‚Äù Biden said recently. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of women out there with the experience to do that job.‚Äù Source: CBS News

The question isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúIs America ready for a female Vice President‚Äù, it‚Äôs ‚ÄúIs America ready for a female Vice President that ate salad with a comb and made her staffer clean it after she was finished?‚Äù

Klobuchar‚Äôs anger problems are legendary‚Äìit‚Äôs the stuff of NYTimes columns and mockery in The Atlantic.

This might be the very first zero personality ticket for president in the history of the United States.

Don‚Äôt believe me? Check out Amy Klobuchar‚Äôs ‚Äújoke‚Äù that she keeps telling.

Amy Klobuchar has a joke she'd like you to hear pic.twitter.com/5mh5IQepva ‚Äî The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) September 6, 2019

Yikes!

He‚Äôs literally got a binder with all of his information in front of him‚Äìunless Klobuchar got her hands on it and threw it at some staffer for the Biden Virtual Rally ‚Äúglitches.‚Äù

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Klobuchar is perhaps the least insane of the Democrats that decided to run for the nomination, and wouldn‚Äôt actually be the most awful pick. She just has the likeability of a turnip. She‚Äôs also a ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù from a purple state and that may not go over well with the Bernie Bro/AOC/‚ÄùDemocratic Socialist‚Äù wing of the Democratic party. But perhaps its because ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù Joe has morphed into Bernie Lite and needs someone moderate to balance him out.

Whoever wins these ‚ÄúVeepstakes‚Äù it‚Äôs clear that their primary job will be to prop up Joe Biden.

From the moment COVID-19 hit some of the global administrations have appeared to be determined to portray an alternate reality around this outbreak. Using some of the incorrect information that has been provided the COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus that is no worse than the seasonal flu, and some of those responses claim that it this a hoax and media coverage of the virus is nothing more than a part of a political conspiracy.

Much of this messaging and narrative comes from tossed off tweets, impromptu public statements, and public announcements. In reality global health officials are raising growing concerns about the outbreak and efforts to play down COVID-19 which has officially been called a pandemic by W.H.O. To add to the play down efforts they are being greatly amplified by the multi-platform propaganda apparatus that are lobbying for (re)election ranging from administration communications, to keyboard commandos, meme warriors of the internet, prime time partisans, to campaigns running on places such as Facebook. Wherever it may be appearing the overarching false message is still the same: Pay no mind to the fake news and fear mongering about COVID-19 as it is lies and political hype, everything is fine.

Any who choose to open their eyes and actually look for themselves can see the overwhelming truth in plain sight. Actual trained scientists, experts, and fact checkers are desperately scrambling to try and correct misleading information. In America according to the CDC: NO the virus has not been contained, that is an impossible task, NO testing is not widely available to anyone who wants it. Most importantly this is not similar to the common cold or flu meaning most definitely NO people should not go to work or school if they are feeling ill.

But the misleading responses to the outbreak unfortunately seem to have resonated even in America as a Quinnipiac University poll released this week has found that only 35% of Republicans are concerned about the virus compared to 68% of the Democrats, and it couldn‚Äôt be at a worse time as this could help further the spread of COVID-19 rather than slow it‚Äôs spread to help containment efforts.

Global responses to this outbreak are also drawing some comparisons to that of the autocratic regimes in Iran and China where they tried to deny any issue and tightly control all information of detriment to the local population and watching world. What some administrations are showing is that they don‚Äôt need to force silence of actual experts, scientists, and researchers of W.H.O or even the CDC or the press to undermine politically inconvenient information about a public health crisis that is actually true and on a global scale, no they can simply step on a soap box and use a bullhorn to drown out anything true or not.

‚ÄúTotal containment isn‚Äôt in the cards, '' said Nancy Messonnier, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention‚Äôs National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. ‚ÄúGiven the nature of this virus and how it‚Äôs spreading, that would be impossible. Our goal is to slow this thing down‚Ä¶ We are preparing as if this were the next pandemic.‚Äù

Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner, has been warning for months about the possibility of this virus spreading to America. Here is a 6 minute video of an interview where he talks about those who may be more vulnerable, the likely unknown spread, and the current lack of American diagnostic capability: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rel6TDmAnbE ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just seeing the tip of the iceberg.‚Äù

According to W.H.O the virus will cause a mild respiratory infection in about 80% of those infected, about half will have pneumonia and another 15% will develop severe illness with at least 5% needing critical care. W.H.O stresses that fundamental public health interventions can still help to limit the spread and drive down cases of transmission even in areas where it is spreading rapidly as the work from authorities in China, Singapore, and South Korea are showing.

‚ÄúThis is not just a public health crisis, it is a crisis that will touch every sector ‚Äî so every sector and every individual must be involved in the fight,‚Äù says W.H.O Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus who said that this is the first coronavirus to reach pandemic levels and also said ‚Äúwe have never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe cannot say this loudly enough or clearly enough or often enough: All countries can still change the course of this pandemic,‚Äù Tedros said Wednesday. 90% of the cumulative cases have been reported in 4 countries is evidence that the rest of the world still had time to prevent an explosion of cases with action.

Officials from W.H.O. stress that countries should be implementing a strategic combination of containment and mitigation measures that involves trying to detect and stop chains of transmission with isolation and quarantines as well as community level steps such as social distancing to limit the possibility of broad spread from unknown sources that may not be able to be traced or tracked. W.H.O is eminently dismissing questions that efforts such as this are too costly or resources intensive given what could happen if countries do not slow the spread of this disease.

‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre seeing is successful are the fundamentals of public health,‚Äù said Maria Van Kerkhove, who heads WHO‚Äôs emerging diseases and zoonoses unit. ‚ÄúBy protecting themselves, they‚Äôre preventing the onward transmission, which may lead to another vulnerable person,‚Äù while no one is immune, those who are more vulnerable include older and younger populations and those with existing health issues such as diabetes and heart disease.

Mike Ryan, the head of the WHO‚Äôs emergency program admits that public health interventions will not stop the virus dead in its tracks but it will help to slow the spread and flatten the curve to avoid adding burden to an overwhelmed health system.

Tedros points to the lack of some countries in resources, capacity and resolve as their officials have been arguing for weeks that some are not moving quickly enough to prepare for an outbreak. While Tendros declined to criticize individual member states publicly, there was note of failures of some countries to trace contacts, communicate clearly, test widely, and failure to coordinate among agencies as well as between federal governments and states, etc.

‚ÄúYou know who you are,‚Äù Ryan said about the countries that were not responding adequately.

This seems to strike home here in the United States where American responses are obviously hampered by more than one of these problems such as most notable the lack of available testing.

It appears that Dr. Deborah Birx has taken Trump's side, chastising the US agency for what she claims are inflated COVID death numbers. US observers explain the conflict between Trump and the medical experts and shed light on Birx's ""political game"".

As calls for reopening the US economy become louder inside the Trump camp, tensions between the White House and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have soared. CDC director Robert R. Redfield and counterpart Anthony Fauci, the head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) have repeatedly warned the president's Coronavirus Task Force against reopening the country too soon. According to some reports, it is Dr. Deborah Birx, however, who has Trump's ear.

Birx: Mediator or New Political Player in WH?

Birx was recently dubbed by Axios ""the real power doctor"" on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, emphasising the physicians' ""masterful political skills"". According to Axios, ""Birx strategically emphasises the points Trump wants to hear"". She, in particular, is highly critical of the World Heath Organization (WHO) and insists that the global entity is badly in need of reform. Birx has claimed that WHO's tracking system is inflating mortality rates and case numbers by up to 25 percent. She has also asserted that ""there is nothing from the CDC that [she] can trust"", according to The Washington Post. On Thursday, Birx touted recent reports claiming sharp declines in both deaths and hospitalisations across the country, claims that could accelerate the reopening of the US economy.

""Dr. Birx role has been highly questionable in the early stages, but she appears to have become more responsible of late"", observes James Fetzer, professor emeritus at University of Minnesota.

He emphasises the doctor's criticism of CDC tabulation of COVID-related deaths which she claims distort and inflate COVID-19 statistics. According to Fetzer, Birx has declared that ""The White House has been completely justified in discounting the 'experts' from NIH, the WHO and the CDC"".

Birx previously decried what she described as media exaggeration and fear-mongering over the deadly virus, noted Pamela Geller, an American political activist, blogger and editor-in-chief of the Geller Report, in the the top health official's critiques of the CDC.

""The level of misinformation and disinformation is deeply troubling"", she suggests. ""The continuing shutdown of our country is the biggest mistake in American history, and the White House is correct in repeatedly calling for reopening"".

Birx is Trying to Balance Between Science & Calls to Reopen

American journalist and author Daniel Lazare is not impressed by Birx's performance: ""Deborah Birx may think she's the 'Trump whisperer' who can keep him under control"", he says. ""But she's only able to do so is by telling him what he wants to hear"".

The journalist is skeptical about Birx's attempts to ""defend"" Trump in the press. According to Lazare, she sometimes distorts reality in an apparent attempt to appease the president. ""On 28 March, she declared in a press conference that 'almost 40 percent of the country' has 'extraordinarily low numbers' of COVID cases, neglecting to mention that those are rural areas containing only 7.2 percent of the US population"", he notes.

Birx is not much of a political player, she is just ""trying to balance between the Trump administration's desire to rapidly reopen and basic scientific facts"" opines Caleb Maupin, speaker, writer, journalist, and political analyst.

""She is trying to play a centrist position, as is Fauci"", he says. ""Birx and Fauci trying to navigate in the middle of this, and they're facing kind of an onslaught from Trump's supporters in the Trump administration"".

¬© REUTERS / Jonathan Ernst White House medical advisors, including Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health, White House coronavirus coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx, Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Director Robert Redfield and U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams listen to the daily coronavirus task force briefing with President Donald Trump at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 22, 2020

Science is Held Hostage to Political & Economic Interests

The CDC has seemingly taken a backseat in the White House task force and is playing a much quieter role than at initial stages of the pandemic, as media remark on Fauci's absence from interviews this week ‚Äì as the country reopens ‚Äì as similarly noteworthy. The CDC release of detailed guidance for reopening schools, mass transit and nonessential businesses was made without a formal announcement, and came only after a number of states started lifting lockdowns, according to CNBC.

According to Maupin, the CDC, as well as other health agencies, have fallen victim to mounting pressure in some parts of the US.

""It would be seen as undermining the medical community at a time when they need support"", the journalist says. ""It's an indirect form of pressure, but it shows that science is deeply impacted by society. There's a whole history of this. Science is not independent"".

The political analyst suggests that ""science is always impacted by the society that creates it"" and ""political interests that fund research would prefer one outcome as opposed to another"". The issue of dropping the lockdown measures has also become a playground for various business interests, with some industries, like Walmart and Amazon, benefitting from the lockdown, while the real sector is desperately pushing to reopen.

""We have one section of the American elite that wants the science to say we can reopen now and the American elite that wants to say science says we have to be closed down as long as we possibly can"", Maupin says, additionally claiming that the so-called elite is ""paying scientists to say what they want"".

The dysfunctional dynamics at play between the CDC and White House are clear for all to see, echoes Ethan Ralph, founder of conservative website, The Ralph Retort.

""I think it's fairly obvious that there's been tension for awhile now"", he says. ""I don't think Trump really wanted to shut things down in the first place and was basically scared into it. Ever since then, he's been moving to open up as quickly as possible. Some see this as reckless, even within his own virus response high command"".

'Political & Health Officials Should Work in Unison'

Though the CDC has its problems, it must be remembered that the agency is dealing with Trump, who is determined to reopen the economy regardless of the cost to public health, and whatever the agencies say or do is going to be wrong, argues Daniel Lazare. According to him, ""the tension between the White House and the CDC is just the latest manifestation of the chaos that has reigned since the virus first appeared in the US in late January"".

The controversy between the White House and the country's health and science community is only exacerbating the problem, according to Professor Kelley Lee, tier 1 Canadian research chair in Global Health Governance.

""The countries that respond most effectively during this pandemic will be countries where public health officials and political leaders work in close unison, and where public health experts are allowed to define policy action"", Lee said.

What's going on in the US is the opposite, Lee remarked. According to him, the Trump administration ""has frequently ignored the advice of scientific experts and prioritised political and economic interests instead"".

While CDC has been subject to harsh criticism by the Trump administration and its conservative supporters, the truth of the matter is that SARS-CoV-2 is an absolutely new virus no one has ever dealt with, underscores Mitchell Feierstein, a hedge-fund manager and CEO of the Glacier Environmental Fund Limited.

""As far as the CDC - everyone has a view on COVID-19, which in reality, is a virus that no one yet fully understands - we have incomplete data sets and no safe vaccine"", Feierstein highlights. ""What we do know is that it's certainly not like the flu"".

According to him, ""the tension between the White House and the CDC is just the latest manifestation of the chaos that has reigned since the virus first appeared in the US in late January"".  The controversy between the White House and the country's health and science community is only exacerbating the problem, according to Professor Kelley Lee, tier 1 Canadian research chair in Global Health Governance.  ""The countries that respond most effectively during this pandemic will be countries where public health officials and political leaders work in close unison, and where public health experts are allowed to define policy action"", Lee said.  What's going on in the US is the opposite, Lee remarked. According to him, the Trump administration ""has frequently ignored the advice of scientific experts and prioritised political and economic interests instead"".  While CDC has been subject to harsh criticism by the Trump administration and its conservative supporters, the truth of the matter is that SARS-CoV-2 is an absolutely new virus no one has ever dealt with, underscores Mitchell Feierstein, a hedge-fund manager and CEO of the Glacier Environmental Fund Limited.  ""As far as the CDC - everyone has a view on COVID-19, which in reality, is a virus that no one yet fully understands - we have incomplete data sets and no safe vaccine"", Feierstein highlights. ""What we do know is that it's certainly not like the flu"".  The views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik."

The lawsuits face an enormous hurdle in sovereign immunity. With limited exceptions, Americans cannot sue foreign governments based on a doctrine built into international treaties. I am not a lawyer, so I will not prognosticate on the lawsuits.

The new coronavirus originated in bats and began infecting people in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. This does not, to my mind, create liability. Viruses periodically jump from animals to humans; and each time, it happens somewhere. Should we have been financially liable for the 2009 H1N1 swine flu and 1918 Spanish flu pandemics which originated here?

China initially denied the existence of the new virus and downplayed its spread. Yet this is not without precedent. The Spanish flu began in U.S. Army training camps. Even as hundreds of soldiers fell ill, units were sent to France with no warning offered, spreading the illness worldwide. The ensuing pandemic claimed an estimated 50 million lives.

International health experts have also made misstatements. The World Health Organization (WHO) equivocated on person-to-person transmission until late January and did not declare a global pandemic until March 11. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) thought that isolating symptomatic travelers from China and very limited testing could contain the virus. The CDC only recently acknowledged the value of masks despite weeks of reports about presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission.

China has almost certainly underreported numbers of cases and deaths. But so have other nations. Medical experts believe that the case fatality rate for COVID-19 is perhaps one percent. The official fatality rates currently are 4.1 percent in the U.S., 12.8 percent in the U.K. and Italy, and 15.3 percent in France. These rates imply underreporting of cases by factors of four to fifteen. Pneumonia deaths among persons never tested are not necessarily getting attributed to COVID-19.

Health data is very inaccurate, even with our enormous medical establishment. The ‚Äúfog of war‚Äù is thick during a pandemic. Misstatements must go well beyond the pale to rise to intentional distortion.

I think China can be fairly criticized for not fully cooperating immediately with the CDC and WHO. Emergent new viruses challenge humanity‚Äôs collective medical knowledge. The novel coronavirus‚Äôs DNA was posted on January 10, greatly assisting medical researchers. Still, every day matters with a new virus; the brightest medical minds must get to work as soon as possible.

COVID-19 will result in a fragile environment for international trade and global society. The novel coronavirus will not disappear once the current outbreak is controlled. Pandemic potential will exist until the virus circulates widely or a vaccine is developed. One contagion model suggests that 97 percent of Americans will not have had COVID-19 after this outbreak. Our current disaster could be repeated many times over.

Reopening the American economy without triggering a new pandemic will require great care. Reopening international trade and travel will require even greater care and trust: an outbreak in any nation could ignite a repeat. I suspect Americans and Europeans will not accept a significant renewed pandemic risk due to trade and travel.

China is very significant in the global economy but the Chinese government‚Äôs lack of transparency has eroded the trust necessary for globalization. Will we trust China to be truthful so any renewed outbreak can be contained? I suspect not, with real economic consequences.

Employees of the National Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology named after N. F. Gamalei of the Ministry of Health of Russia tested their vector vaccine against COVID-19. The experiment was successful: immunity was confirmed, no negative effects were found, Alexander Gunzburg, the director of the center said.

""As for the developers, they tested it on themselves to protect themselves in the first place, so that they could continue developing the vaccine during the pandemic. Everyone involved in the development are protected accordingly,"" said Alexander Gunzburg.

Answering the question of whether there were any side effects, the academician replied:

""No. Everyone is alive, healthy and happy.""

He did not specify the number of colleagues who tested the vaccine on themselves, although, according to him, it goes about a wide circle of employees of the center - developers, organizers of preclinical studies and technologists.



The vaccine that the research center is developing is a promising vector vaccine based on the DNA of the adenovirus, in which the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus gene was integrated. The adenovirus is used as a ""container"" to deliver the coronavirus gene to cells, launch the synthesis of the coat proteins of the new coronavirus (the 'corona,' which earned the coronavirus its name) and thereby ""introduce"" the immune system to the potential enemy. Vaccines of this type are known as vector vaccines.



In mid-May, Alexander Gunzburg said that the vaccine was successfully tested on small animals - mice and guinea pigs. He also said that if the trials on primates, and then on volunteers, end successfully, the production of the vaccine against coronavirus in Russia may begin in August. However, it will be impossible to provide the vaccine to all citizens of the Russian Federation, the academician said. The vaccine will be delivered to doctors, law enforcement officers and social workers in the first place.

The daily increase in the number of new cases of COVID-19 in Russia remains at about the same level for three consecutive days, while the number of deaths in one day was the largest for the entire period of the coronavirus situation in Russia.

In South Korea there have been over 10,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 245 deaths, that is a 2.3% fatality rate which is lower than the 3.4% averaged as stated by W.H.O. In South Korea a total of 277 patients were reported to have fallen ill for a second time, as with China and Japan.

The apparent reinfections prompted concerns over the virus mutating at a rate so quickly that people would not be able to build immunity against it. The following genetic analyses of the virus did not yield any substantial changes in the virus that would effectively disguise it from the immune system.

The South Korean CDC has found that the PCR test results for the suspected relapsed patients were false positives, warning that the tests were not able to distinguish between live traces of the virus and the harmless dead samples that remain after the patient has recovered.

W.H.O is warning that immunity certification will depend upon the accuracy and reliability of the testing that is being rapidly developed, which under normal circumstances take years of trials to determine.

I penned a prior report, extrapolating from published flu studies, which predicts that 6/10ths-to-1.3% serious side effects after mandated coronavirus vaccination among the nation‚Äôs 72.6 million senior adults would hospitalize 435,000-943,000 and a subsequent 1.4% mortality rate would then result in 54,202-111,493 deaths.

These hospitalizations and deaths are not necessarily caused by a vaccine, which is always pre-tested for safety among healthy adults who DO respond to vaccination by making antibodies, but from weak immunity among certain known risk groups.

Here are four ways the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic could have already been brought to a ‚Äúdead stop.‚Äù

1. Coronaviruses produce seasonal disease, running 5 months from November to the end of March. This is the period when the earth tilts away from the sun in northern latitudes resulting in less vitamin D production in human skin combined with colder weather that causes people to bundle up in clothing, which makes things worse. And what do health authorities demand the public do? Stay indoors under quarantine and prolong the agony of this unprecedented pandemic.

If you haven‚Äôt noticed, quarantines don‚Äôt work. Look at the data from Italy (‚ÄúAll of Italy Is In Lockdown As Coronavirus Cases Rise‚Äù ‚Äì CNN)

Americans must defy health authorities and go outside and bask in mid-day (10 AM to 2 PM) sunshine with skin exposed. Some of the news media ridicules individuals who ignore orders to stay indoors, inciting fear by reporting death counts that are only normal for the season and may not even be caused by coronavirus. ( NOTE: WHN is not recommending breaking any orders, and it is possible to stay inside and open a window/door to bask in the sun.)

Only a few infectious disease investigators have noted climatic conditions (cold temperature) drives people indoors (as do quarantines) that not only reduce vitamin D blood levels but also increase disease severity.

Coronaviruses are believed to be in circulation through the rest of the year but sunshine vitamin D keeps them from erupting. The man who is running the CDC, keeps pushing for prolongation of the quarantine/lockdown that is literally priming the disease. That same man said, before Congress, Covid-19 coronavirus is ‚Äú10 times more lethal than seasonal flu.‚Äù But was quoted four days later in the New England Journal of Medicine to say ‚Äúthe case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1%‚Ä¶.. and may be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%.‚Äù

Forcing people indoors increases transmission of seasonal viruses by 18.7 times compared to open-air environments. This information is contained in a report issued by the CDC itself [Emerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 26, June 2020]. Obviously, the left hand doesn‚Äôt know what the right hand is doing at the CDC.

While the world awaits a coronavirus vaccine, vitamin D is many times more effective than the flu vaccine. These discoveries have not been embraced by public health authorities.

There is also strong evidence that many virally-infected patients also have tuberculosis, particularly in foreign-born immigrants. TB is also a seasonal lung infection, like cold and flu viruses (i.e. coronavirus). Vitamin D is a known antidote for TB.

Given that coronavirus infection threatens high-risk individuals, a more targeted vitamin D supplementation campaign among diabetics, obese individuals, tobacco smokers and alcohol imbibers would likely serve to reduce cases of infection as well as subsequent hospitalizations and deaths.

It would cost society far less to target high-risk groups with the provision of vitamin D supplements and even sun lamp therapy than it would to vaccinate masses of people who will never be infected or hospitalized.

Pharmacies seeing patients who fit high-risk criteria could hand out free bottles of vitamin D provided by the government or at least recommend vitamin D to every patient.

Vaccines aren‚Äôt reliable prevention for high-risk individuals who don‚Äôt efficiently produce antibodies. Vitamin D therapy would represent true prevention. The Centers for Disease Control purchases vaccines from pharmaceutical manufacturers and could do the same for vitamin D. Of course, this would be anathema to physicians. Dispensing from pharmacies would likely be more do-able.

Influenza costs ~$10.4 billion a year for hospitalizations, doctor visits, vaccines and medicines. The provision of vitamin D pills during the 5 months of the cold and flu season for the nation‚Äôs 12 million senior adults aged 80+, considered the highest risk group, would cost just ~$200 million and would likely prevent billions of dollars of disease and death.

2. According to various reports, about 2-in-10 to 3-in-10 of coronavirus cases occur among health care and hospital personnel. The Centers for Disease Control does recommend healthcare personnel be provided respirators or masks. But after many years of drafting plans to fight seasonal flu outbreaks and epidemics, the CDC was caught unprepared. Masks and respirators are in short supply. What is needed are N-95 (0.3-micron filter) respirators, which are not available.

An alternative would be to use N95 respirators and N95 masks intended for industrial purposes, which are available, and adapt them for medical use.

Here the nation is 3 months into its battle against seasonal flu and COVID-19 coronavirus, and it is just now figuring out how to supply n95 masks and respirators to healthcare personnel. Be aware, some studies show N95 respirators compared to N95 masks reduce illness from 17% to just 6.2%. However, this was for transmission of bacteria, not viruses like coronavirus. However, as stated by Dr. Lawrence Broxmeyer, a great deal of the infectious lung disease now being treated is caused by a bacterium ‚Äì tuberculosis.

If the public health agencies and hospitals can‚Äôt provide ambulance paramedics, nurses and ancillary health personnel proper protection, maybe we need crowdfunding by the public to buy them N95 respirators, so in case we do have to go to the hospital, we don‚Äôt have the disease transmitted from doctor/nurse to patient.

3. The lack of any approved drug or vaccine for coronavirus has prompted the search for natural non-prescription remedies. The trace mineral zinc is one of the natural remedies that have been revealed in this coronavirus pandemic as an antidote to coronavirus infection.

It has been demonstrated that the trace mineral zinc inhibits the replication of coronavirus in infected cells via its ability to block RNA synthesis. Coronaviruses are RNA viruses.

Drugs that improve zinc utilization and facilitate zinc entry in cells, such as chloroquine, have now become well known for their ability to quell coronavirus infections. To prove the underlying mechanism that makes this drug work, chelation (removal) of zinc reverses this effect.

The President of the United States declared chloroquine, used to treat malaria, a ‚Äúgodsend,‚Äù which was quickly pounced upon by political opponents and given widespread news coverage. But the FDA just now issued emergency approval of chloroquine for coronavirus.

Quercetin, an extract from red apples, and EGCG from green tea are also zinc ionophores (binders) like chloroquine.

Few physicians realize that unbound (free) bioavailable zinc is kept at a low level by binding to its carrier (metallothionein). The trace mineral selenium induces release of zinc from its binder, facilitating more bioavailable zinc.

If the public catches on, zinc could replace vaccines.

4. Diligent physicians who treat volumes of patients can accelerate research as there is no time to wait for results from clinical trials. There is no time for peer review. To avoid needless deaths, real-time work-in-progress studies can fast-track clinical data needed by medical personnel worldwide.

One such example is that of Vladimir Zelenko in New York who reports an unusually high coronavirus infection rate of 65% among the first 200 patients tested. The successful use of the therapeutic triad of an antibiotic (azithromycin), an autoimmune drug (hydroxychloroquine) and zinc sulfate among 699 infected patients has resulted in zero deaths, zero need for respirators with just 4 patients admitted to the hospital; in other words, zero death rate. Of note, both azithromycin and chloroquine are used to treat tuberculosis.

Notice the central role zinc is playing in the prevention and treatment of coronavirus. Zinc has only come out of the closet as a last resort. Yet it has been available for decades. Studies involving zinc lozenges have produced mixed results, but it has been noted that only zinc acetate lozenges that deliver a given amount of zinc have been found effective. Most zinc lozenges on the market do not deliver sufficient dosage to quell a viral infection. About 75-92 milligrams a day has been shown to be effective when given in a slow-release lozenge.

It is difficult to come to any other conclusion than that public health agencies aren't exactly operating in the public‚Äôs best interest. In fact, either by issuance of bad policies and health edicts or neglect of less problematic and more economical remedies, Americans can‚Äôt rely on public health agencies for the best advice on how to avoid or treat coronavirus infections.

Given that the news media parrots health policies to the public without question says Americans are being delivered nothing but high-end propaganda and need to obtain health information from other sources. Don‚Äôt listen to politicians who complain about a lack of hospital ventilators. According to one emergency room physician, 70-90% of virally infected patients with pneumonia that are placed on ventilators die. Ventilators are a last-ditch effort to buy time and hope for a cure. Americans will have to cure the coronavirus epidemic on their own.

Fear will be played to the hilt now to coerce the population into forced vaccination and 100% monitoring of our whereabouts, which was the objective of the plannedemic from the beginning. Because fear trumps information and logic.",,USA,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,Americans Will Have To Cure The Coronavirus Epidemic on Their Own,"Original article written by Bill Sardi can be viewed on LewRockwell.com; the following is an excerpt which represents the author's opinion and does not necessarily reflect those of WHN:  I penned a prior report, extrapolating from published flu studies, which predicts that 6/10ths-to-1.3% serious side effects after mandated coronavirus vaccination among the nation‚Äôs 72.6 million senior adults would hospitalize 435,000-943,000 and a subsequent 1.4% mortality rate would then result in 54,202-111,493 deaths.  These hospitalizations and deaths are not necessarily caused by a vaccine, which is always pre-tested for safety among healthy adults who DO respond to vaccination by making antibodies, but from weak immunity among certain known risk groups.  Here are four ways the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic could have already been brought to a ‚Äúdead stop.‚Äù  1. Coronaviruses produce seasonal disease, running 5 months from November to the end of March. This is the period when the earth tilts away from the sun in northern latitudes resulting in less vitamin D production in human skin combined with colder weather that causes people to bundle up in clothing, which makes things worse. And what do health authorities demand the public do? Stay indoors under quarantine and prolong the agony of this unprecedented pandemic.  If you haven‚Äôt noticed, quarantines don‚Äôt work. Look at the data from Italy (‚ÄúAll of Italy Is In Lockdown As Coronavirus Cases Rise‚Äù ‚Äì CNN)  Americans must defy health authorities and go outside and bask in mid-day (10 AM to 2 PM) sunshine with skin exposed. Some of the news media ridicules individuals who ignore orders to stay indoors, inciting fear by reporting death counts that are only normal for the season and may not even be caused by coronavirus. ( NOTE: WHN is not recommending breaking any orders, and it is possible to stay inside and open a window/door to bask in the sun.)  Only a few infectious disease investigators have noted climatic conditions (cold temperature) drives people indoors (as do quarantines) that not only reduce vitamin D blood levels but also increase disease severity.  Coronaviruses are believed to be in circulation through the rest of the year but sunshine vitamin D keeps them from erupting. The man who is running the CDC, keeps pushing for prolongation of the quarantine/lockdown that is literally priming the disease. That same man said, before Congress, Covid-19 coronavirus is ‚Äú10 times more lethal than seasonal flu.‚Äù But was quoted four days later in the New England Journal of Medicine to say ‚Äúthe case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1%‚Ä¶.. and may be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%.‚Äù  Forcing people indoors increases transmission of seasonal viruses by 18.7 times compared to open-air environments. This information is contained in a report issued by the CDC itself [Emerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 26, June 2020]. Obviously, the left hand doesn‚Äôt know what the right hand is doing at the CDC.  While the world awaits a coronavirus vaccine, vitamin D is many times more effective than the flu vaccine. These discoveries have not been embraced by public health authorities.  There is also strong evidence that many virally-infected patients also have tuberculosis, particularly in foreign-born immigrants. TB is also a seasonal lung infection, like cold and flu viruses (i.e. coronavirus). Vitamin D is a known antidote for TB.  Given that coronavirus infection threatens high-risk individuals, a more targeted vitamin D supplementation campaign among diabetics, obese individuals, tobacco smokers and alcohol imbibers would likely serve to reduce cases of infection as well as subsequent hospitalizations and deaths.  It would cost society far less to target high-risk groups with the provision of vitamin D supplements and even sun lamp therapy than it would to vaccinate masses of people who will never be infected or hospitalized.  Pharmacies seeing patients who fit high-risk criteria could hand out free bottles of vitamin D provided by the government or at least recommend vitamin D to every patient.  Vaccines aren‚Äôt reliable prevention for high-risk individuals who don‚Äôt efficiently produce antibodies. Vitamin D therapy would represent true prevention. The Centers for Disease Control purchases vaccines from pharmaceutical manufacturers and could do the same for vitamin D. Of course, this would be anathema to physicians. Dispensing from pharmacies would likely be more do-able.  Influenza costs ~$10.4 billion a year for hospitalizations, doctor visits, vaccines and medicines. The provision of vitamin D pills during the 5 months of the cold and flu season for the nation‚Äôs 12 million senior adults aged 80+, considered the highest risk group, would cost just ~$200 million and would likely prevent billions of dollars of disease and death.  2. According to various reports, about 2-in-10 to 3-in-10 of coronavirus cases occur among health care and hospital personnel. The Centers for Disease Control does recommend healthcare personnel be provided respirators or masks. But after many years of drafting plans to fight seasonal flu outbreaks and epidemics, the CDC was caught unprepared. Masks and respirators are in short supply. What is needed are N-95 (0.3-micron filter) respirators, which are not available.  An alternative would be to use N95 respirators and N95 masks intended for industrial purposes, which are available, and adapt them for medical use.  Here the nation is 3 months into its battle against seasonal flu and COVID-19 coronavirus, and it is just now figuring out how to supply n95 masks and respirators to healthcare personnel. Be aware, some studies show N95 respirators compared to N95 masks reduce illness from 17% to just 6.2%. However, this was for transmission of bacteria, not viruses like coronavirus. However, as stated by Dr. Lawrence Broxmeyer, a great deal of the infectious lung disease now being treated is caused by a bacterium ‚Äì tuberculosis.  If the public health agencies and hospitals can‚Äôt provide ambulance paramedics, nurses and ancillary health personnel proper protection, maybe we need crowdfunding by the public to buy them N95 respirators, so in case we do have to go to the hospital, we don‚Äôt have the disease transmitted from doctor/nurse to patient.  3. The lack of any approved drug or vaccine for coronavirus has prompted the search for natural non-prescription remedies. The trace mineral zinc is one of the natural remedies that have been revealed in this coronavirus pandemic as an antidote to coronavirus infection.  It has been demonstrated that the trace mineral zinc inhibits the replication of coronavirus in infected cells via its ability to block RNA synthesis. Coronaviruses are RNA viruses.  Drugs that improve zinc utilization and facilitate zinc entry in cells, such as chloroquine, have now become well known for their ability to quell coronavirus infections. To prove the underlying mechanism that makes this drug work, chelation (removal) of zinc reverses this effect.  The President of the United States declared chloroquine, used to treat malaria, a ‚Äúgodsend,‚Äù which was quickly pounced upon by political opponents and given widespread news coverage. But the FDA just now issued emergency approval of chloroquine for coronavirus.  Quercetin, an extract from red apples, and EGCG from green tea are also zinc ionophores (binders) like chloroquine.  Few physicians realize that unbound (free) bioavailable zinc is kept at a low level by binding to its carrier (metallothionein). The trace mineral selenium induces release of zinc from its binder, facilitating more bioavailable zinc.  If the public catches on, zinc could replace vaccines.  4. Diligent physicians who treat volumes of patients can accelerate research as there is no time to wait for results from clinical trials. There is no time for peer review. To avoid needless deaths, real-time work-in-progress studies can fast-track clinical data needed by medical personnel worldwide.  One such example is that of Vladimir Zelenko in New York who reports an unusually high coronavirus infection rate of 65% among the first 200 patients tested. The successful use of the therapeutic triad of an antibiotic (azithromycin), an autoimmune drug (hydroxychloroquine) and zinc sulfate among 699 infected patients has resulted in zero deaths, zero need for respirators with just 4 patients admitted to the hospital; in other words, zero death rate. Of note, both azithromycin and chloroquine are used to treat tuberculosis.  Notice the central role zinc is playing in the prevention and treatment of coronavirus. Zinc has only come out of the closet as a last resort. Yet it has been available for decades. Studies involving zinc lozenges have produced mixed results, but it has been noted that only zinc acetate lozenges that deliver a given amount of zinc have been found effective. Most zinc lozenges on the market do not deliver sufficient dosage to quell a viral infection. About 75-92 milligrams a day has been shown to be effective when given in a slow-release lozenge.  It is difficult to come to any other conclusion than that public health agencies aren't exactly operating in the public‚Äôs best interest. In fact, either by issuance of bad policies and health edicts or neglect of less problematic and more economical remedies, Americans can‚Äôt rely on public health agencies for the best advice on how to avoid or treat coronavirus infections.  Given that the news media parrots health policies to the public without question says Americans are being delivered nothing but high-end propaganda and need to obtain health information from other sources.

Americans will have to cure the coronavirus epidemic on their own.  Fear will be played to the hilt now to coerce the population into forced vaccination and 100% monitoring of our whereabouts, which was the objective of the plannedemic from the beginning.

(TMU) ‚Äì For much of the world, it‚Äôs been weeks if not months since we entered lockdown. And while humanity hitting the ‚Äúpause‚Äù button has seemingly been a blessing in disguise for some creatures who have used the respite to enjoy clean air and water for the first time in decades, other animals actually may miss us human beings.

Such appears to be the case for the dolphins who hang out at Tin Can Bay in Queensland, Australia, where the sea mammals have been lining up to bring gifts ashore ‚Äì ‚Äúapparently because they‚Äôre missing interaction with humans,‚Äù according to a report by 7News.

Barnacles Caf√© and Dolphin feeding is typically filled with tourists throughout the year, and offers visitors the priceless opportunity to interact with wild humpback dolphins. And the wild dolphins do enjoy the opportunity to be treated to fresh fish by happy visitors.

But Australia began imposing strict quarantine rules in the middle of March, visitors stopped lining up to feed the animals ‚Äì and the humpbacks may be worried about the sudden disappearance of their land-loving bipedal friends.

According to Barnacles, the local dolphin pod has been presenting gifts to staff at the caf√©, ranging from barnacle-encrusted bottles to sea sponges and fragments of coral.

A post on the cafe‚Äôs Facebook page read:

‚ÄúThe pod has been bringing us regular gifts, showing us how much they‚Äôre missing the public interaction and attention. They are definitely missing you all.‚Äù

A volunteer at the caf√© told reporters from ABC that while the pod has displayed this behavior in the past, the gestures have been increasing since the venue shut down.

For dolphin expert and University of Queensland PhD student Barry McGovern, the explanation for the dolphins‚Äô behavior could be far more mundane.

‚ÄúNothing surprises me with dolphins and their behavior anymore. They do everything ‚Äì they use tools, they have culture, they have something similar to names in signature whistles.‚Äù

In general, dolphins are one of the most intelligent animal species on the planet. From their playful nature to their sociability and friendliness toward humans, as well as their legendary interactions with seafarers, dolphins have inspired the adoration of humans since time immemorial.

Increasingly, human researchers are discovering that dolphins display skills and sophistication previously attributed only to the human species, including strong problem solving capabilities and a complex system of communication.

However, this doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that we should project our own feelings of longing borne of the quarantine onto ocean mammals. McGovern explained:

‚ÄúIn all likelihood, they probably don‚Äôt miss humans per se ‚Ä¶ They probably miss a free meal and the routine.‚Äù

Dolphins are also generally prone to ‚Äúplay-like behavior.‚Äù McGovern said:

‚ÄúThey often play with bits of weed and coral and all sorts of things and just leave it on their rostrum (nose).They‚Äôre used to getting fed now, so they‚Äôre used to humans coming in. When it‚Äôs not happening, maybe it‚Äôs just out of boredom.‚Äù

Since coronavirus restrictions are being phased out, Barnacles Caf√© has reopened and they have resumed dolphin feeding activities.",,USA,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,Dolphins Bring Gifts From the Sea in Apparent Response to Lack of Human Interaction,"14.7K Shares Facebook  Twitter  Reddit  Email  Get the latest from The Mind Unleashed in your inbox.
