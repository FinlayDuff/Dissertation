Tags Syria Eastern Ghouta Douma Syrian regime bombing Siege White Helmets Three rescue workers from the Syrian Civil Defence - better known as the White Helmets - have been killed in bombing in a besieged Damascus suburb the group said on Friday. The men were killed as they provided aid to civilians injured in bombing in Syrias Eastern Ghouta region when the air strike took place. Other workers from the rescue team were also injured in the attack the group said with four children and one man killed in earlier regime shelling. \"The civil defence [White Helmets] condemns the bombing and raids on the cities and towns of eastern Ghouta which focuses on targeting civilian centres and aid workers\" the group said in a statement. \"Today the regime air force targeted [a] Syrian civil defence team [as they were] working in Douma city. Three volunteers were killed and most of the other volunteers were injured.\" Siege Watch claimed the workers were targeted by a \"guided missile\" which follows routine \"double tap\" attacks on bomb sites as rescue workers attempt to save survivors. Opposition Damascus suburb Eastern Ghouta has been subject to ferocious bombing and shelling by the Syrian regime this week. At least six children were among 12 civilians killed in the district during bombing and shelling on Friday Siege Watch reported. The White Helmets said that 45 people have been killed and 307 injured in three days of regime attacks on Eastern Ghouta. These include the use of 38 banned cluster bombs drone attacks hundreds of shells and five surface-to-surface missiles. Eastern Ghouta is also subject to a horrific siege which is starving the civilian population and leaving them without desperately needed medical equipment and medicine activists and NGOs say. White Helmets volunteers are the first on the scene at sites hit by bombs and shells with scores killed in subsequent attacks. The group are believed to have saved the lives of more than 100000 Syrians injured in bombings. Read Also"

Cross-border artillery fire by Turkish troops destroyed at least six weapon caches and one armed vehicle it said. The Turkish military has repeatedly targeted northern Syria with artillery shells guided missiles and mortars to hit militants who Ankara says have fired rockets at southern Turkish border towns. There have also been reports of operations by Turkeys Special Forces inside the Syrian territory. Turkey has also hinted at establishing a safe zone in the 98-kilometer (60-mile) stretch between Manbij in Aleppo Province and the Turkish border prompting objections from Iran and Russia. The US has supported the plan describing it as part of a deepening campaign by the Turkish army to push ISIS away from a vital 60-mile stretch of the Turkey-Syria border that serves as the groups main lifeline. Turkey and the US however do not see eye to eye on Washingtons support for Kurdish militants in northern Syria. Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said last week Turkey would not allow cooperation with terrorist organizations in Syria referring to Kurdish groups which the US supports. Turkey says the fighters are a terrorist organization affiliated with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) but the US sees them as a partner in Syria operations. In a speech to his ruling AK Party in parliament last Tuesday Yildirim said Turkey wont allow formation of new states in Syria echoing suspicion that the Kurdish campaign was aimed at establishing a separate state.

The blast struck as a group of youths celebrated the graduation of a student who was one of those killed in the attack in the dining area of Mogambo on Thursday said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. \"The attack also wounded 19 people including some in critical condition\" said the Britain-based organisation. The official SANA news agency also reported the attack and singled out the death of the journalist it identified as Al-Ikhbariya TV correspondent Hassan Muhanna. The attack occurred in a part of Aleppo controlled by the regime of President Bashar al-Assad which has been fighting an armed uprising for more than two years in a conflict that has killed more than 100000. On May 27 another Al-Ikhbariya journalist was killed by a sniper in the then rebel stronghold of Qusayr. Prior to his death media watchdog Reporters Without Borders said 23 journalists had been killed in Syria since the countrys conflict erupted in March 2011."

Abdel Rahman indicated that Suri was meeting with other leading terrorists in Kafar Jales when the raids took place. Two other Al-Nusra and Jund al-Aqsa targets were also hit and many were seriously injured he added. Syrian Suri real name Radwan Nammous fought against the Soviet forces in Afghanistan where he met Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and Abdullah Azzam a bin Laden mentor before returning to Syria in 2011 the AFP reported citing his supporters on Twitter.

Tags Syria Eastern Ghouta Douma Syrian regime bombing Siege White Helmets Three rescue workers from the Syrian Civil Defence - better known as the White Helmets - have been killed in bombing in a besieged Damascus suburb the group said on Friday. The men were killed as they provided aid to civilians injured in bombing in Syrias Eastern Ghouta region when the air strike took place. Other workers from the rescue team were also injured in the attack the group said with four children and one man killed in earlier regime shelling. \"The civil defence [White Helmets] condemns the bombing and raids on the cities and towns of eastern Ghouta which focuses on targeting civilian centres and aid workers\" the group said in a statement. \"Today the regime air force targeted [a] Syrian civil defence team [as they were] working in Douma city. Three volunteers were killed and most of the other volunteers were injured.\" Siege Watch claimed the workers were targeted by a \"guided missile\" which follows routine \"double tap\" attacks on bomb sites as rescue workers attempt to save survivors. Opposition Damascus suburb Eastern Ghouta has been subject to ferocious bombing and shelling by the Syrian regime this week. At least six children were among 12 civilians killed in the district during bombing and shelling on Friday Siege Watch reported. The White Helmets said that 45 people have been killed and 307 injured in three days of regime attacks on Eastern Ghouta. These include the use of 38 banned cluster bombs drone attacks hundreds of shells and five surface-to-surface missiles. Eastern Ghouta is also subject to a horrific siege which is starving the civilian population and leaving them without desperately needed medical equipment and medicine activists and NGOs say. White Helmets volunteers are the first on the scene at sites hit by bombs and shells with scores killed in subsequent attacks. The group are believed to have saved the lives of more than 100000 Syrians injured in bombings. Read Also"

At least 23 ISIS (Daesh) militants have been killed by Turkish artillery fire and US airstrikes in northern Syria a Turkish broadcaster claims. As many as 33 targets were hit in the joint operation which was carried out against militants preparing for an attack on Turkey Haberturk reported on Monday. Cross-border artillery fire by Turkish troops destroyed at least six weapon caches and one armed vehicle it said. The Turkish military has repeatedly targeted northern Syria with artillery shells guided missiles and mortars to hit militants who Ankara says have fired rockets at southern Turkish border towns. There have also been reports of operations by Turkeys Special Forces inside the Syrian territory. Turkey has also hinted at establishing a safe zone in the 98-kilometer (60-mile) stretch between Manbij in Aleppo Province and the Turkish border prompting objections from Iran and Russia. The US has supported the plan describing it as part of a deepening campaign by the Turkish army to push ISIS away from a vital 60-mile stretch of the Turkey-Syria border that serves as the groups main lifeline. Turkey and the US however do not see eye to eye on Washingtons support for Kurdish militants in northern Syria. Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said last week Turkey would not allow cooperation with terrorist organizations in Syria referring to Kurdish groups which the US supports. Turkey says the fighters are a terrorist organization affiliated with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) but the US sees them as a partner in Syria operations. In a speech to his ruling AK Party in parliament last Tuesday Yildirim said Turkey wont allow formation of new states in Syria echoing suspicion that the Kurdish campaign was aimed at establishing a separate state.

The blast struck as a group of youths celebrated the graduation of a student who was one of those killed in the attack in the dining area of Mogambo on Thursday said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. \"The attack also wounded 19 people including some in critical condition\" said the Britain-based organisation. The official SANA news agency also reported the attack and singled out the death of the journalist it identified as Al-Ikhbariya TV correspondent Hassan Muhanna. The attack occurred in a part of Aleppo controlled by the regime of President Bashar al-Assad which has been fighting an armed uprising for more than two years in a conflict that has killed more than 100000. On May 27 another Al-Ikhbariya journalist was killed by a sniper in the then rebel stronghold of Qusayr. Prior to his death media watchdog Reporters Without Borders said 23 journalists had been killed in Syria since the countrys conflict erupted in March 2011."

Two other Al-Nusra and Jund al-Aqsa targets were also hit and many were seriously injured he added.
