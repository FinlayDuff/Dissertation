                        "article_content": "Experts predict string of quarantines in Russia before 2021\n\nRussia is going to see four scenarios with the development of the coronavirus pandemic. The most probable one of them is described as push-and-pull: repeated waves of morbidity and a string of quarantines until 2021.\n\nExperts at the international consulting company Boston Consulting Group (BCG) believe that according to one of the four scenarios, the virus would be stopped, and the crisis would be limited to only one wave. In this case, the country will lose 4-6% of GDP. Non-food retail businesses and services would be suspended as a result of the lockdown, which may last for about two months in each region. Businesses will recover quickly after the lockdown ends. However, many small businesses will close, which will increase the level of unemployment.\n\nUnder the critical recession scenario, Russia will lose 10-15% of GDP. The virus crisis will last longer, and the country will see stringent quarantine measures. Industrial production and construction will stop, which will lead to a decrease in demand for resources, primarily hydrocarbons and steel. A large-scale liquidity crisis will begin throughout the Russian economy, which will put an excessive burden on the banking system.\n\nAnother scenario would be similar to the period, in which Russia found herself in the early 1990s after the collapse of the USSR. In this scenario, the world will see long-term recession in global economy, but BCG experts do not see any prerequisites for it.\n\nIn the most plausible scenario of quarantine cycles, Russia's GDP will decline by 7-10% compared to 5%, which the Central Bank and Finance Minister Anton Siluanov predicted. Bursts of morbidity are possible before the end of 2021, because the coronavirus vaccine will be released no earlier than in late 2020.\n\nA long lockdown will lead to numerous bankruptcies in small and medium-sized businesses. In this scenario, the government will be opening and closing the economy depending on the incidence rate. Long-term lockdown will lead to further decline in the sector of services and retail, a drop in demand for real estate and a decrease in production and wholesale trade.\n\nExperts recommend the Russian authorities expand the capacity of medical institutions after quarantine ends, make quarantine more predictable and shorter, and use decisive measures to support the economy during lockdown. If quarantines are short enough (less than 25% of the total pandemic period), it would be cheaper for the state to subsidize wages during this period rather than to support a sharply increased number of unemployed people."

Each test costs 950 rubles ($13), with an extra 200-300 rubles ($3-4) charged for the process of taking the sample. The company is accepting anyone who wants to be tested, apart from those displaying symptoms of an acute respiratory viral infection.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faA positive result indicating the formation of an immune response was detected in 14% of patients. Moreover, in just the first four days, more than 40,000 people were tested for [coronavirus antibodies],\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the company\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s press service said.\n\nAlso on rt.com More than forty medics dead in Dagestan since the beginning of Covid-19 epidemic, according to local health ministry\n\nThe presence of specific antibodies in the blood serum means a person has already been exposed to an infection and has developed immunity, the company explained.\n\nAccording to Invitro, 47% of those tested were from Moscow or the Moscow Region, and 14.6% were in the Northwestern Federal District, where Saint Petersburg is located. In the future, Invitro plans to launch a \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Covid Index\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 on its website, which would display data by city, gender, and age.\n\nIn their press release, Invitro explained that antibody testing can provide a more reliable indication of the extent of the pandemic.\n\nOn May 15, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin announced that the capital city would be rolling out a vast random screening program. According to the mayor, mass testing will enable the government to make more informed decisions about anti-coronavirus measures.\n\nAlso on rt.com Moscow mayor launches unprecedented FREE MASS TESTING system for coronavirus antibodies\n\nIf you like this story, share it with a friend!"

Also put on hold is the requirement for drivers in the Chicago and Metro East regions to get their vehicles\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 emissions tested before they renew their registrations.\n\nIn March, Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White announced the closure of driver services facilities across the state, as the country braced for the COVID-19 pandemic. So far, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not known when driver services facilities will open again, a spokesman for the office said.\n\nBut any drivers who have already met the requirements can renew their registrations online.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe encourage people who are not due [for an emissions test] to get the sticker online,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Dave Druker, a secretary of state spokesman.\n\nWhile vehicle emissions sites are closed through May 30 because of the pandemic, a few have found ways to remain busy. Two vehicle emissions sites \u201a\u00c4\u00ee one in Waukegan and one in Markham \u201a\u00c4\u00ee have been converted into COVID-19 drive-thru testing centers."

                        "article_content": "(Natural News) China has finally admitted to destroying samples of coronavirus early in the outbreak, but they\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4re insisting they did it out of safety concerns rather than as part of any sort of coverup. Given their track record, however, doubts remain about the true motivation behind the move.\n\nA supervisor for China\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4s National Health Commission, Liu Dengfeng, finally admitted in a news conference that the government there issued an order on January 3 directing some facilities to dispose of coronavirus samples. Liu said the order was a measure that aimed to \u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00faprevent the risk to laboratory biological safety and prevent secondary disasters caused by unidentified pathogens.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nLiu added that the labs had been \u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00faunauthorized\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f9 to handle the samples and therefore had to destroy them to comply with public health laws in the country. He stopped short of specifying how the samples were destroyed or why those labs had them in the first place.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been accusing China for months of destroying the samples to cover up the extent of the country\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4s outbreak. Last month, he expressed frustration with the Chinese government for not sharing virus samples from within the country with the rest of the world \u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00ec something that makes it impossible to assess the evolution of the disease.\n\nHe has also accused the country of censoring coronavirus research and trying to influence international efforts to fight the disease. He criticized the country for taking too long to report the outbreak to the World Health Organization and said that even when they did notify them, they failed to share all of the information at their disposal.\n\nLast week, he said: \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe Chinese Communist Party tried to suppress information about this virus, about where it began, about how it started, about how it was being transmitted from human to human, indeed employed the World Health Organization to further that storyline.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe U.S. has been impacted disproportionately by the disease, with almost one quarter of the world\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4s infections and deaths being seen in America. So far, more than 4.59 million people have tested positive for the disease globally and at least 309,000 have died according to official numbers \u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00ec although the real death toll is widely believed to be far higher.\n\nPresident Trump has said he\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4s \u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00favery disappointed in China\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f9 and that he has no desire to talk to Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nIntelligence reports show China acted irresponsibly\n\nA report from the department of Homeland Security shows that American officials believe that China intentionally covered up how severe the pandemic was in early January while hoarding medical supplies. Meanwhile, a leaked dossier by the Five Eyes intelligence alliance outlines how Beijing has caused some whistleblowers to mysteriously \u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00fadisappear\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f9 and scrubbed mentions of the disease in its early stages from the internet while destroying virus samples. They called their actions an \u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00faassault on international transparency.\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f9\n\nOther intelligence agencies have reached similar findings. For example, Der Spiegel reported on a German intelligence document that suggests the Chinese president personally pressured the Director-General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, into holding back info about human-to-human transmission and delaying a pandemic warning.\n\nIn fact, Germany\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4s Federal Intelligence Service estimated that China\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4s actions \u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00falost four to six weeks to fight the virus worldwide.\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f9\n\nIs it any surprise that the majority of Americans view China negatively and have no confidence in President Xi?\n\nWe already knew that China destroyed those samples, so admitting to doing so and making up an excuse for it isn\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4t going to do much to make them look any better. In fact, it will only add fuel to the rumors of coverups that are going on in the country, including those surrounding how this disease came into existence in the first place. If they were really so worried about \u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00fasafety,\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f9 they would have acted far differently from the\u221a\u00c7 start of this pandemic, and thousands of people around the world who have died in the last few months might still be alive and with their loved ones today.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nNYPost.com\n\nNewsweek.com\n\nDailyMail.co.uk\n\nPewResearch.org"

Kay Oxendine is a member of the Haliwa Saponi Tribe in North Carolina.\n\n\"Every year we know it's coming; like, the birds sing differently,\" she told NPR. \"It's almost like spring arrives when the powwow does.\"\n\nOxendine is an author and educator and the mistress of ceremonies for a number of powwows in the eastern U.S. It's a job she loves: telling stories to the crowd and introducing the dancers, singers and drummers. She was set to be the first woman to emcee her tribe's powwow, scheduled for Friday, April 17, to Sunday April 19, at the Tribal Ceremonial Grounds in Hollister, N.C.\n\nAbout 5,000 people would've been there, but she knew it would be canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. What she says she didn't expect was that her mind and body were still expecting the celebration.\n\n\"So I wake up on Friday morning and it's like I wake up and I open my eyes and I'm looking, oh, my God, it's here! Literally was like a kid. And I jumped out of bed, and I'm like YAY, and I said to my son, it's powwow time. And he was like, 'Mom.' \"\n\nShe felt physically ill.\n\n\"I actually threw up. I actually I got physically ill. It felt like I was pregnant but couldn't give birth.\"\n\nThen, she says she noticed on Facebook that a member of the Haliwa Saponi Tribal Council had scheduled a virtual Haliwa powwow. \"And I'm like, man, you know, stop, what are you doing?\" It seemed like such a strange idea.\n\nBut she says it was wonderful \"because what she did, she encouraged people to still dress in their regalia. And so one of our previous tribal administrators, Archie Lynch, who is also my cousin, he lit a fire and he was out there and he had sage. He was blessing the grounds. It was in his backyard. But, you know, it just meant the world to me.\"\n\nFollowing the powwow, there's normally an after party with a deejay. This year, one of the tribal members held a virtual after party.\n\n\"We were brought up on Otis Redding and soul music around here \u201a\u00c4\u00ee music that just makes you want to get up and dance,\" she says.\n\nSo Oxendine got up and danced.\n\n\"I'm sitting in my room, the music is blasting. I'm sitting in front of my computer, I'm dancing in my living room. My son thinks I've lost my mind. \"\n\nIt was just what her spirit needed.\n\n\"It was it was just the most beautiful thing I think I've ever encountered. It helped me. It really helped me heal a lot.\""

                        "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Nearly eight years after he was last on the ballot, Barack Obama is emerging as a central figure in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nDemocrats are eagerly embracing Obama as a political wingman for Joe Biden, who spent two terms by his side as vice president. Obama remains the party\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s most popular figure, particularly with black voters and younger Democrats, and Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s presidential campaign is planning for him to have a highly visible role in the months to come.\n\nFor President Donald Trump, that means an opportunity to focus the spotlight on one of his favorite political foils. In recent days, Trump and his allies have aggressively pushed conspiracy theories about Obama designed to fire up the president\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s conservative base, taint Biden by association and distract from the glut of grim health and economic news from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faPartisans on both sides want to make this about Obama,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Ned Price, who served as spokesperson for Obama\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s White House National Security Council.\n\nThe renewed political focus on Obama sets the stage for an election about the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s future that will also be about its past. As Biden looks to Obama for personal validation, he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s also running to restore some of the former president\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s legacy, which has been systematically dismantled by Trump. The current president is running in part to finish that job.\n\nYet Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s anti-Obama push also frequently takes on a darker, more conspiratorial tone that goes far beyond differences in health care policy and America\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s role in the world. His current focus is on the actions Obama, Biden and their national security advisers took in the closing days of their administration, as they viewed intelligence reports about Michael Flynn. Flynn had a short-lived stint as Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s national security adviser before being fired for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his interactions with Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ambassador to the U.S.\n\nTrump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s own administration acknowledged on Wednesday that Obama advisers followed proper procedures in privately \u201a\u00c4\u00faunmasking\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Flynn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s name, which was redacted in the intelligence reports for privacy reasons. Flynn ultimately pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, though Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Justice Department moved last week to drop the case against him.\n\nDespite there being no evidence of wrongdoing by Obama, Biden or other administration officials, Trump is eagerly pushing the notion of an unspecified crime against the former president, branding it \u201a\u00c4\u00faObamagate.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s being backed up by Republican allies, including Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley who took to the Senate floor this week to ask of the Flynn matter: \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat did Obama and Biden know, and when did they know it?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nTrump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s zeal has sparked fears among some former Obama and Biden advisers about how far he may be willing to go in using the levers of government to push his case against them in an election year. The Justice Department is conducting an investigation into the origins of the Russia probe that ensnared Flynn and other Trump associates.\n\nTrump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s renewed focus on Obama comes as Republicans grow increasingly anxious that the rising coronavirus death toll and cratering economy will damage the president\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s reelection prospects in November. More than 84,000 Americans have died from the virus, and more than 30 million have claimed unemployment.\n\nBiden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s campaign drew a direct connection between the president\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attacks on Obama and the twin crises battering his administration.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s no surprise that the president is erratically lashing out at President Obama, desperate to distract from his own failures as commander in chief that have cost thousands of Americans their lives during this crisis,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said TJ Ducklo, a Biden campaign spokesman.\n\nTrump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s emphasis on Obama also comes as the former president begins to emerge from a three-year period of political restraint as he prepares to embrace his role as leading surrogate for Biden. Last week, Obama told a large gathering of alumni from his administration that DOJ\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision to drop the Flynn case put the \u201a\u00c4\u00farule of law at risk.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 He also criticized the Trump White House\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBiden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s campaign has been eager to get Obama involved in the election, though his exact role is still forming, particularly given that the pandemic has upended the campaign\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s plans for rallies and other in-person events in battleground states. The former president is also expected to campaign for Democratic House and Senate candidates across the country.\n\nThough Obama campaigned for Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterms, he has mostly tried to avoid overt politics since leaving the White House. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s spoken out publicly against Trump on rare occasions, frustrating many Democrats who have wanted him to be more aggressive in calling out his successor.\n\nBut the 2020 election has always loomed as the moment when Obama would step off the sidelines, and he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s told advisers he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s eager to do so. Despite his strident public neutrality during the Democratic primary, he spoke to Biden regularly and has continued to do so as the campaign moves into the general election, according to aides.\n\nBiden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s campaign sees Obama as a clear asset as they seek to not only energize Democrats,but to also appeal to independents and more moderate Republicans who may be wary of four more years of Trump in the White House.\n\nA recent Monmouth University poll found 57% of Americans say they have a favorable opinion of Obama. That includes 92% of Democrats and 19% of Republicans.\n\nObama\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s favorable ratings are higher than either of the men who will be on the ballot in November. The same poll showed 41% of Americans had a favorable opinion of Biden, and 40% viewed Trump in a favorable light."

                        "article_content": "NEW YORK \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Lala, a 3-month-old black Lab, romped into Ufuoma George\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s life a few weeks ago, just as she retreated into her New York apartment in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nLala, she thought, would be company. But she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s turned out to be so much more.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faBeing alone at home kind of is hard,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 says George, \u201a\u00c4\u00fabut with a pet you have someone to take care of, someone to play with you, someone to greet you in the morning, so it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s kind of like really calming and comforting.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nWhether it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a dog, a cat or, yes, a hedgehog named Quillie Nelson, pets are proving to be unexpected heroes in lockdown. They include the newly adopted and fostered like Lala; people have flooded shelters, looking for pets to fill their extra hours at home.\n\nLaura Evans, her husband and their three kids brought 12-week-old Zoe to their Bethesda, Maryland, home after the pandemic hit. The squirmy Yorkshire terrier needs constant attention, and they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re happy to oblige.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe wanted to bring a little light and life to our house,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Evans said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faShe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a cuddly work, homework sidekick. Everyone wants to hang with her.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nNancy Karan said her pet Shadow gets her out of her New York apartment for quality time with her fellow dog walkers, at a safe distance. At night they sleep together, \u201a\u00c4\u00fabecause it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s very comforting just to have his body on my bed.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nIn Houston, Quillie Nelson and other pets help maintain routines for Rachael Pavlik and two teens.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI think having pets during a scary time like this is good for the whole family. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s good for the kids to have a sense of normalcy and a sense of responsibility, like they have to get out of bed before noon to feed their animals,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said.\n\nKitty Block, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, urged more people to foster and adopt as the health crisis worsens.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt frees up space in the shelter to take these animals in that may be displaced because their family member, their owner is ill or financially in a troubled situation,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said.\n\nWhile many people seek comfort, some frustrations have surfaced with all the togetherness. Professional dog trainer Nicole Ellis in Los Angeles, of the service Rover.com, said owners should make a conscious effort to tire out their animals before a Zoom meeting or important phone call.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t blame them if they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re like, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m bored! I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m bored!\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 and they haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t done anything all day. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not their fault,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said.\n\nThat doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t seem to be a problem for Squiggles, a bearded dragon in South Orange, New Jersey. Dan Cohen\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 13-year-old daughter, Julia, has survived with help from her chill lizard, who has her own emotional support vest and tiny mask.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want her catching coronavirus,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he joked.\n\nAubrey Fine, a licensed psychologist and professor emeritus at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona said the relationship is mutually beneficial between humans and animals.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIn a time of tremendous and unique life challenges, goodness is still around us. When you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re looking at souls, animals touch human souls and humans touch animal souls. And together serendipity can happen.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9"

                        "article_content": "In Brief The Facts: Major events have a lasting impact on human consciousness, and help people see what they once never saw before. This appears to be happening with the new coronavirus.\n\nReflect On: How do events like 9/11, and the new coronavirus impact human consciousness?\n\nIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s truly an exciting time to be alive, and that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s because more and more people are \u201a\u00c4\u00fawaking up\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to concepts about our reality and the overall human experience that they were once previously unaware of. This has been happening for decades, but every single year it seems to amplify, and the process of our \u201a\u00c4\u00f2awakening\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 seems to accelerate rapidly.\n\nThis type of \u201a\u00c4\u00f2awakening\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 happens in all areas that surround human life. People learn deep truths about health and medicine, education, geopolitics, consciousness, extraterrestrials and much more. The idea that a small group of corporations and the people that run them have a strong hold on our perception, thoughts, emotions, and reactions regarding information and major world events is now far from a mere \u201a\u00c4\u00faconspiracy theory\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in the eyes of many. It can be seen quite clearly, and mainstream media has been exposed as the true bearer of \u201a\u00c4\u00fafake news\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 by many people.\n\nEvents like the coronavirus simply accelerate the process of awakening, and expose mainstream media outlets for what they truly are in this moment. There\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a reason why mainstream media has such strong connections to intelligence agencies and have their roots in psychological warfare. You can find documentation and examples of that in an article I published a while ago here.\n\nA quote from Edward Bernays, known as the father of public relations, is powerful because it sums up these thoughts quite well:\n\nThe conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.\n\nCurrent Events & Collective Consciousness\n\nWhen 9/11 happened, we were told that terrorists attacked the World Trade Centre. As the months and years went on, more and more people grew suspicious of their government\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s explanation of what happened that day, this included many politicians and academics as well, further adding fuel to the fire. Evidence came forward, science was done and whistleblowers spoke out, giving us a very clear idea that what we were told happened that day, most certainly did not. Today, many polls show that more than half of the American people alone don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t believe the official explanation of what really happened that day. Since 9/11, hundreds of millions of people have become aware of \u201a\u00c4\u00fafalse flag\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 terrorism, which is the idea that the \u201a\u00c4\u00f2powers that be\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 created these events, fund terrorism, stage them, and then use these events to justify the infiltration of another country for ulterior motives. They basically create the problem, in several different ways, and then propose the solution.\n\nOrganizations like Wikileaks and whistleblowers like Edward Snowden have proved, as well as explained, how events like these are used to justify a heightening national security state, one where more and more of our basic rights and freedoms are stripped from us under the guise of \u201a\u00c4\u00f2goodwill.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\n\nBut these events have shifted human consciousness. People become aware of how our world truly works and functions, a process we call \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Breaking The Illusion\u201a\u00c4\u00f2 here at CE. People begin to see that the world they think is real is actually not, and that things like corruption exist within the geopolitical realm, an important realization if you wish to reflect on whether our political process truly serves us or not. This then changes the perception of people around the world, causing us to choose new paths and actions as to how to live our lives in society. Paths that would not change if we never \u201a\u00c4\u00f2broke the illusion.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\n\nAnother major event is happening right now, the COVID-19 pandemic. When it comes to COVID-19, what has many people asking questions is the ban and censorship of information. For example, YouTube is now actively banning any content that contradicts anything that the World Health Organization (WHO) states with regards to the new coronavirus. Vimeo recently banned a documentary exposing \u201a\u00c4\u00faBig Pharma\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 influence within the WHO. These blatant forms of censorship have some upset, but many others see it as an eyebrow-raising moment, showing quite clearly the corruption that exists in our world and the efforts that are put forth to control the perception of the masses. We then begin to ask why?\n\nControlling information and what people think is important if you wish to control their lives. This is why \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Breaking The Illusion\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 is one of the first steps in the CE formula to shift consciousness. After all, why do you think people like Julian Assange are in jail, and people like Edward Snowden are living in exile?\n\nHow far have we sunk if telling the truth becomes a crime? How far have we sunk if we prosecute people that expose war crimes for exposing war crimes? How far have we sunk when we no longer prosecute our own war criminals? Because we identify more with them, than we identify with their people that actually expose these crimes. What does that tell about us and about our governments? In a democracy, the power does not belong to the government, but to the people. But the people have to claim it. Secrecy disempowers the people because it prevents them from exercising democratic control, which is precisely why governments want secrecy. Nils Melzer (source)\n\nWith COVID-19, we are also seeing a large number of people questioning the measures that multiple governments have taken to lockdown countries. We are seeing people question the information that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s being put out by our federal health agencies, including the World Health Organization. We have seen a number of scientists in the field, as well as doctors, also question the official narratives, and we have seen people like Edward Snowden, and many more, explain how this \u201a\u00c4\u00f2pandemic\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 is being used for ulterior motives. You can access those articles at the end of this article if you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re interested.\n\nI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve said it before and I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll say it again, we are now living in a time where a digital authoritarian \u201a\u00c4\u00f2fact checker\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 is patrolling the internet and censoring content it deems as \u201a\u00c4\u00f2false.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 It does not matter if the information is true or false, backed by science or not, or whether it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s simply an opinion, if it doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t align with the mainstream narrative, you are not meant to see it or trust it. Should people not have the right to examine information, check sources, decide for themselves what is real and what is fake?\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nCOVID-19 has simply accelerated the process of awakening, and it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s also made even more people aware of the censorship of information that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s taking place. Along with the censorship of information, comes ridicule, and bashing by mainstream media in order to oppose and instantaneously shut down any opposite narrative.\n\nNarratives that go against mainstream media narratives are not acknowledged or countered, they are simply ridiculed and deemed a \u201a\u00c4\u00faconspiracy theory.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe point is, events like this serve the collective. They wake us up, they help us see, they help shift the perceptions about our world and our world \u201a\u00c4\u00f2leaders\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 and serve as a catalyst for more people to start asking questions, and to see that what we are told is not always what is. This is why events as such, although hard in many senses, and real in many ways, do indeed move humanity forward in a \u201a\u00c4\u00f2positive\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 direction. What\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s happening now is not a tragedy, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s exciting, and it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not as bad as they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve made it out to be.

The county\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s death toll rose Thursday to 2,021, with more than 42,000 confirmed cases.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is a very sad milestone for us,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 county Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Thursday after the deaths exceeded 2,000.\n\nLos Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis said she hoped officials could ease stay-at-home restrictions soon but urged caution.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI wish that we could speed things up,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe virus is still out there waiting for us to let our guard down.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nDespite the average daily death toll, which has remained at a stubborn plateau for weeks, there were new signs that even Los Angeles is beginning to turn the corner.\n\nThe coronavirus transmission rate in the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s most populous county is now in its best position since the magnitude of the outbreak became clear in March.\n\nStill, officials remain concerned that warm temperatures and quarantine fatigue could drive people from their homes over the Memorial Day weekend, resulting in crowding at parks and beaches that could threaten to undo some of the progress the state has made.\n\nIn San Francisco, the parks department painted 10-foot circles on the grass of four city parks ahead of the holiday weekend to remind visitors to follow social distancing rules.\n\nIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s part of a pilot program based on a similar effort at Domino Park in Brooklyn, said Tamara Barak Aparton, spokeswoman for San Francisco Recreation and Parks.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to be warm this weekend and we knew people would be out, so we thought it would be a good time to get feedback on whether this helps,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Aparton said. If successful, the circles could be expanded to more locations, she said.\n\nIn Orange County, several coastal cities expanded their beach hours and planned to open more parking lots connected to the shoreline ahead of the holiday.\n\nSeal Beach, which initially allowed public access only Mondays through Thursdays from sunrise to sunset, is now welcoming beachgoers from 4:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week, officials said earlier this week. Some beach parking lots also reopened. Beaches are open for active use only.\n\nA few miles south, Huntington Beach and Newport Beach also are allowing beach access on weekends, ahead of the Memorial Day holiday. Newport is now open 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., while Huntington Beach opens an hour earlier.\n\nLaguna Beach, however, is maintaining stricter hours on Saturdays and Sundays, with its coastline closing at noon each day.\n\nWhile Los Angeles County beaches also have reopened for active use, only some parking lots are open.\n\nIn addition to the reduced transmission rate, L.A. County has seen other encouraging indicators, including a 12% decrease in its latest seven-day average of deaths per day and a 15% decrease in its most recent three-day average for hospitalizations per day, Ferrer said Thursday.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe progress we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve made in slowing the spread, the reduction in the average daily deaths and hospitalizations and retaining capacity in our health care system \u201a\u00c4\u00ee this lets us know that the extraordinary efforts and sacrifices made by all of you are working,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAs a community, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve done this together, and this progress is a direct reflection of what all of you in your day-to-day lives have been able to accomplish.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nStill, she said, officials will continue to keep a close eye on those metrics to ensure they don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t creep up as more people are out in the public due to businesses and recreation areas reopening.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThrough our recovery journey, as we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re all out of our homes more, it may become more difficult to slow the spread, but it is far from impossible,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said.\n\nThough experts say it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s still too soon for L.A. County to move into a more aggressive phase of recovery, much of California has progressed to a point where officials feel it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s safe to lift more of the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s stay-at-home order and allow more businesses to reopen.\n\nThe number of new coronavirus cases across the state declined from the previous week, and hospitalizations have dropped more than 15% from a peak six weeks ago, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis.\n\nMost counties have received approval to progress more quickly through Phase 2 of the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s reopening road map \u201a\u00c4\u00ee meaning they can open restaurant dining rooms and more retail businesses for in-store shopping.\n\nThe list of counties that can ramp up their reopening efforts now includes San Diego \u201a\u00c4\u00ee the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s second-most populous \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Kern, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura.\n\nThat comes as officials revealed that California\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unemployment rate nearly tripled from mid-March to mid-April, with the state losing an unprecedented 2.3 million payroll jobs across all sectors of its economy as a result of the pandemic.\n\nApril\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s jobless rate skyrocketed to 15.5%, up from 5.5% a month before, sweeping past the Great Recession\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s peak of 12.3% a decade ago, state officials reported Friday.\n\nThe Golden State\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s jobless rate is higher than the nationwide rate of 14.7%, reflecting California\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s reliance on tourism, hospitality and entertainment businesses.\n\nStill, some local officials are urging tourists to stay away \u201a\u00c4\u00ee at least for now. Multiple counties have expressed concern about people visiting and possibly bringing with them the coronavirus, especially during the Memorial Day weekend.\n\nDr. Penny Borenstein, San Luis Obispo County\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s health officer, asked tourists to not visit as the county reopened many shops and restaurants this week. While officials have performed \u201a\u00c4\u00faspot checks\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with hotels to deter tourism, Borenstein said the county would cite visitors only in the case of \u201a\u00c4\u00faegregious violations.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nRemote Alpine County urged tourists to stay away when the virus began to spread through California in March.\n\nDr. Richard Johnson, the Alpine County public health officer, said last month there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s no medical care to treat visitors who fall ill with COVID-19.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThere\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s no way we would even have ground or air resources to get them out,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Johnson said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a dangerous assumption that you can come and look at us as a safe haven. It is an unsafe haven.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nCommunities in the Lake Tahoe region, which heavily depend on tourism as well, have issued reminders before the holiday weekend warning that leisure travel is not permitted.\n\nOn its website, the city of South Lake Tahoe said that while second homeowners are now welcome, other visitors are still not. Lodging will not be available to short-term renters.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe would love nothing more than to welcome everyone to Tahoe right now, but that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not the safest way to bring people back to South Lake,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 City Manager Joe Irvin said in a statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe need to be responsible and make sure we are doing our part to keep our neighbors safe and Tahoe safe while adhering to the governor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s stay at home orders.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00ee\u201a\u00c4\u00ee\u201a\u00c4\u00ee\n\n(Bierman reported from Washington.

That's going to inverse.'\n\nDia Dipasupil/Getty Images for Tribeca Film Festival\n\nAirbnb is about connecting people. Before this crisis, we brought 2 million people together a day, and when this crisis ends, we're going to get back to doing just that. But to get there, we are going to need to be scrappy. We're going to be nimble, we're going to simplify our operations and focus on what makes us different: our community of hosts.\n\nNo one knows for sure [how the crisis will change the travel industry], but I can give you two thoughts. First, when the comeback starts, it will start locally. People are going to take trips that are close to home and they're going to want something affordable. Second, I think we're seeing that you can do a lot [via] video conferencing, and that's going to have a big impact on how often people travel for work. Business travel isn't going to go away, but I think it's going to look very different in the future.\n\nWe used to do a lot of travel for work and then we entertained ourselves on screens. That's going to inverse. I think we'll work more on screens and entertain ourselves in the real world.\n\nI also think many people are realizing they don't have to be tethered to one city. So you'll see more people who are going to choose to live around the world, spending a few months at a time in different places. And we're going to focus in part on longer-term stays to better serve those people.\n\nI've also been thinking about what won't change. In 1950, 25 million people crossed a border, and last year 1.4 billion people did. That happened because there is an innate human desire to travel, to explore and that is never going to go away. Travel may be on pause, but it's going to come back."

                        "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Federal officials responding to the coronavirus pandemic are concerned about the rapidly rising number of cases in Palm Beach County, Fla., according to an internal Trump administration document reviewed by Yahoo News.\n\nThe document, a May 13 daily interagency update on the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s coronavirus response circulated by the Department of Homeland Security, notes new areas of concern for coronavirus. It was provided to Yahoo News by one of its recipients under the condition that that recipient not be identified.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faAs most states have begun phased re-opening, several COVID-19 hot spots continue to emerge,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the notice says. Three counties are then listed: Palm Beach; San Bernardino County, Calif.; and Marshall County, Ala.\n\nThe Gardens Mall food court opened Friday morning for the first time in nearly two months. (Damon Higgins/Palm Beach Post via Zuma Wire) More\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faPalm Beach County, FL reported a 71% increase in new cases the last 7 days compared to the previous 7 days,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the document explains. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe state authorized Palm Beach County to begin Phase 1 of reopening on 11 May, which includes the reopening of barbershops, salons, restaurants, and other businesses.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nPresident Trump recently changed his primary residence from Manhattan to his Mar-a-Lago golf resort, which is located in Palm Beach County.\n\nThe information in the document is attributed to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and was collected on May 12, which means cases were rising even before the county began to reopen on May 11. Other parts of the state had begun to reopen earlier, on May 4.\n\nNeither FEMA nor the DHS responded immediately to a request for comment.\n\nThe DHS document says that San Bernardino County in California \u201a\u00c4\u00fareported an increase of 782 cases in the last 7 days, nearly doubling new cases reported in the previous 7 days. County officials recently began Phase II of the county\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s reopening plan, lifting requirements for mask use on 8 May.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nMarshall County, Ala., the document says, \u201a\u00c4\u00fareported 217 cases in the last 7 days, a 517% increase over the previous 7 days. Marshall County is home to several poultry plants and the meat packing industry accounts for 8% of the county\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s employment. On 11 May, additional businesses were reopened.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nPublic health officials have warned that lifting stay-at-home orders would lead to more infections and, inevitably, more deaths. Some governors have either discounted or dismissed such warnings, as has President Trump.\n\nAscend the Trend Barbershop in Palm Beach is open for business, May 11, 2020. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images) More\n\nEncompassing the beachfront and inland communities north of Miami, Palm Beach County has a population density about four times that of Marshall County, which is in the northeastern corner of Alabama, and seven times that of San Bernardino County, which encompasses the desert region east of Los Angeles. Population density is thought to contribute to the spread of the coronavirus, which causes the lung disease known as COVID-19. That disease has killed more than 87,000 Americans, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\n\nThe coronavirus also tends to strike older people. The average age of a Palm Beach County resident is 45 years old, whereas the average Marshall County resident is 39 years old and the San Bernardino County resident is only 33 years old.\n\nPalm Beach is home to many retirement communities, a fact that worries health officials. The county has recorded 263 coronavirus deaths, three more than the entirety of South Korea, which recorded its first coronavirus case on the same late January day as the United States."

Using some of the incorrect information that has been provided the COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus that is no worse than the seasonal flu, and some of those responses claim that it this a hoax and media coverage of the virus is nothing more than a part of a political conspiracy.\n\nMuch of this messaging and narrative comes from tossed off tweets, impromptu public statements, and public announcements. In reality global health officials are raising growing concerns about the outbreak and efforts to play down COVID-19 which has officially been called a pandemic by W.H.O. To add to the play down efforts they are being greatly amplified by the multi-platform propaganda apparatus that are lobbying for (re)election ranging from administration communications, to keyboard commandos, meme warriors of the internet, prime time partisans, to campaigns running on places such as Facebook. Wherever it may be appearing the overarching false message is still the same: Pay no mind to the fake news and fear mongering about COVID-19 as it is lies and political hype, everything is fine.\n\nAny who choose to open their eyes and actually look for themselves can see the overwhelming truth in plain sight. Actual trained scientists, experts, and fact checkers are desperately scrambling to try and correct misleading information. In America according to the CDC: NO the virus has not been contained, that is an impossible task, NO testing is not widely available to anyone who wants it. Most importantly this is not similar to the common cold or flu meaning most definitely NO people should not go to work or school if they are feeling ill.\n\nBut the misleading responses to the outbreak unfortunately seem to have resonated even in America as a Quinnipiac University poll released this week has found that only 35% of Republicans are concerned about the virus compared to 68% of the Democrats, and it couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be at a worse time as this could help further the spread of COVID-19 rather than slow it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s spread to help containment efforts.\n\nGlobal responses to this outbreak are also drawing some comparisons to that of the autocratic regimes in Iran and China where they tried to deny any issue and tightly control all information of detriment to the local population and watching world. What some administrations are showing is that they don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t need to force silence of actual experts, scientists, and researchers of W.H.O or even the CDC or the press to undermine politically inconvenient information about a public health crisis that is actually true and on a global scale, no they can simply step on a soap box and use a bullhorn to drown out anything true or not.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faTotal containment isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t in the cards, '' said Nancy Messonnier, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. \u201a\u00c4\u00faGiven the nature of this virus and how it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s spreading, that would be impossible. Our goal is to slow this thing down\u201a\u00c4\u00b6 We are preparing as if this were the next pandemic.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nDr. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner, has been warning for months about the possibility of this virus spreading to America. Here is a 6 minute video of an interview where he talks about those who may be more vulnerable, the likely unknown spread, and the current lack of American diagnostic capability: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rel6TDmAnbE \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re just seeing the tip of the iceberg.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nAccording to W.H.O the virus will cause a mild respiratory infection in about 80% of those infected, about half will have pneumonia and another 15% will develop severe illness with at least 5% needing critical care. W.H.O stresses that fundamental public health interventions can still help to limit the spread and drive down cases of transmission even in areas where it is spreading rapidly as the work from authorities in China, Singapore, and South Korea are showing.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is not just a public health crisis, it is a crisis that will touch every sector \u201a\u00c4\u00ee so every sector and every individual must be involved in the fight,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 says W.H.O Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus who said that this is the first coronavirus to reach pandemic levels and also said \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe have never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe cannot say this loudly enough or clearly enough or often enough: All countries can still change the course of this pandemic,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Tedros said Wednesday. 90% of the cumulative cases have been reported in 4 countries is evidence that the rest of the world still had time to prevent an explosion of cases with action.\n\nOfficials from W.H.O. stress that countries should be implementing a strategic combination of containment and mitigation measures that involves trying to detect and stop chains of transmission with isolation and quarantines as well as community level steps such as social distancing to limit the possibility of broad spread from unknown sources that may not be able to be traced or tracked. W.H.O is eminently dismissing questions that efforts such as this are too costly or resources intensive given what could happen if countries do not slow the spread of this disease.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re seeing is successful are the fundamentals of public health,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Maria Van Kerkhove, who heads WHO\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s emerging diseases and zoonoses unit. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBy protecting themselves, they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re preventing the onward transmission, which may lead to another vulnerable person,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 while no one is immune, those who are more vulnerable include older and younger populations and those with existing health issues such as diabetes and heart disease.\n\nMike Ryan, the head of the WHO\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s emergency program admits that public health interventions will not stop the virus dead in its tracks but it will help to slow the spread and flatten the curve to avoid adding burden to an overwhelmed health system.\n\nTedros points to the lack of some countries in resources, capacity and resolve as their officials have been arguing for weeks that some are not moving quickly enough to prepare for an outbreak. While Tendros declined to criticize individual member states publicly, there was note of failures of some countries to trace contacts, communicate clearly, test widely, and failure to coordinate among agencies as well as between federal governments and states, etc.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faYou know who you are,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ryan said about the countries that were not responding adequately.\n\nThis seems to strike home here in the United States where American responses are obviously hampered by more than one of these problems such as most notable the lack of available testing. America, the world is watching and will, no IS documenting accordingly."

                        "article_content": "Carlos Atkins, 27, used to spend weekdays with his 2-year-old son Malachi, taking walks and reading books, before heading out into the night to power wash sidewalks, pick up trash and remove graffiti in downtown Detroit for a local nonprofit. Then the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the city and his son\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s day care center but not Atkins\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 job as an essential worker. After being reassigned to a midday shift that ends at 9 pm, he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s scrambled to find child care, leaning heavily on his mom and aunt.\n\nEven clad in a jumpsuit, gloves and mask, his line of work carries health risks and he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s fearful of bringing home the deadly virus to the two-family flat he shares with his son, mother and younger sister. And, fiercely protective of his young charge, he wonders whether his son should return to day care when Michigan reopens.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s overwhelming. I try not to focus on it,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Atkins says. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI just hope and pray for the best.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nWhat schools will look like when they reopen:Scheduled days home, more online learning, lots of hand-washing\n\nWhen will schools reopen?:Not soon, education leaders say, despite Trump's declarations\n\nThe push to reboot the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s economy is leaving millions of parents like Atkins in a tough bind. They can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t go back to work without someone to care for their children, whether preschools or day care facilities, babysitters or relatives. And, even if they can find child care, they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re worried states are moving too quickly and may be putting their kids\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 lives at risk.\n\nLast week the Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected an extension of the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s stay-at-home order. In some places, employees are being called back to work before child care facilities open.\n\nLack of child care is quickly emerging as one of the biggest barriers to the economy bouncing back, says Patricia Cole, senior director of federal policy for Zero to Three, a nonprofit focused on early childhood development.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faChild care is foundational to our nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ability to recover from this crisis,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Cole said during a news briefing put on by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\nCOVID-19 plunges child care system into crisis\n\nCOVID-19 has plunged the child care industry, 90% of which is privately run, into a crisis the likes of which the nation has never seen.\n\nAlready child care centers were expensive to operate and stayed afloat on meager profits. Caregivers and other staffers, a third of whom have been laid off, often get by on poverty wages and public assistance, unable to afford child care for their own children.\n\nNow child care advocates argue the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s already fragile system is at risk of collapse. They are lobbying for billions more in federal aid to ensure reliable child care is available to parents.\n\nThough in many places they were not required to close, since the pandemic began, nearly half of child care facilities nationwide have shut down, some of them indefinitely as the coronavirus forced families to keep kids at home, according to a survey of child care providers conducted by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC).\n\nSeventeen percent of providers have closed to everyone except the children of essential personnel. Of the facilities which have remained open, 85% are operating at less than 50% of enrollment capacity and the majority of those are operating at less than 25% of capacity, the survey conducted in April found.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe don't fully know yet who are the child care providers and facilities that are not going to have survived this economic crisis because they just couldn't keep the doors open,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 says Javaid Siddiqi, CEO of The Hunt Institute, an education nonprofit in Cary, North Carolina.\n\nIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s also unclear how many providers will be able to afford to reopen or at what capacity with strict new health protocols that vary from state to state. Some new rules limit the number of children that can be in any group \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and in many cases require the same children and adults be placed together every day. Child care centers also face higher costs for additional staffing, personal protective equipment, hand sanitizer and cleaning supplies.\n\nSummer camps and programs have also fallen on hard times and are being driven out of business. The ones still standing are trying to figure out if or how they can reopen safely.\n\nHalf of facilities closed, remaining providers stretched\n\nChild care providers that have remained open to watch over the children of essential workers are stretched to the breaking point.\n\nCrystal Perry-Grant, a 38-year-old mother of three, runs a family day care in Perris, California, a small city in Riverside County. For 12-hour stretches with the help of her 17-year-old daughter, she cares for eight children whose parents are essential workers from firefighters to UPS workers, ranging in age from 1 to 9.\n\nSchool-age kids learn remotely on six computers that routinely slow her Wi-Fi to a crawl. She cooks homemade soups from fresh farm produce to boost their immune systems. Hand sanitizer squirted liberally throughout the day into little palms has kept sickness at bay. In the past two months, she hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t had even a single runny nose.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faOur parents need us. They don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have family around. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a dire need. I would feel bad if I closed,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Perry-Grant says. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNo one had a job they could up and quit, so I couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t either.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBut Perry-Grant can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t take on any more children. She has no openings and a long waiting list.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThis goes very much to the heart of whether we are going to be able to just reopen the economy,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 says Michael Madowitz, an economist at the Center for American Progress who studies the child care industry. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThere are a lot of reasons why we can't just flip a switch and this is very high on the list.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nFor Demetriss \u201a\u00c4\u00faDemi\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 DeShazior, a 41-year-old medical assistant in Miami, child care tops her list of concerns.\n\nHer mother babysat her 2-year-old while DeShazior languished on a long waiting list for partially subsidized child care. When she was seven months pregnant, DeShazior learned she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d secured a spot, but this was a month before the pandemic hit. Before she could finish filling out the paperwork, child care facilities closed.\n\nSo DeShazior took family medical leave earlier than she planned in March to stay home with her son. Now she's applying for child care for her toddler and 5-week-old as an essential health worker but her unease is growing.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIf I do return to work, will my babies be safe from contracting COVID-19 at day care?\" DeShazior wonders. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWill I even have day care covered for both babies by my return date?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nNation cannot reopen with kids still at home\n\nEven before the coronavirus tore across the country, parents scrambled to find child care. With too few spots to meet demand, the burden fell heaviest on low-wage parents, women and families of color. Now millions more spots may have evaporated.\n\nTraditional backstops such as grandparents who used to step in to care for children while parents worked belong to populations most vulnerable to the coronavirus.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faMost states are talking about child care, but there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a mixed bag in terms of how many are actually being planful about it. When you as a state say, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re open,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 but then you don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t give guidance around child care, that puts the burden of the situation on families,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 says NAEYC's CEO Rhian Evans Allvin. And that, Allvin, says, \u201a\u00c4\u00faexacerbates the already existing inequities in early childhood education because inherently wealthier families have more options.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nAs more parents prepare to return to work, the enormousness of the challenge facing the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s patchwork child care system is staggering.\n\nFour in 10 working adults have children under 18. Nearly 60% of children under 5 participated in regular weekly care arrangements and a third were enrolled in a child care program of some kind before the coronavirus struck. Yet, with many child care providers from small family day cares to after-school programs closing up shop indefinitely, parents are at loose ends.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faParents who are being called back into work at this point really may find challenges in securing care or even, in some cases, securing the care they were accustomed to,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 says Dan Wuori, director of early learning at The Hunt Institute, which has a database tracking state child care policies.\n\nAmong those parents is Laura Byrd, 35, a human resources generalist from Newark, New Jersey and mother of a 7-year-old who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s been working from home since the start of the pandemic.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faOur \u201a\u00c4\u00f2new normal\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 will pose some difficulties once I am instructed to return to the office. As the state reopens, our day care centers and summer camps will not be operating which will create child care issues for me,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 says Byrd, who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s considering taking a leave of absence if necessary.\n\nAgonizing choices between health risks and paychecks\n\nReopening is forcing parents in Georgia, Florida and other states into an agonizing choice between potentially risking their health and the health of their children and earning a paycheck.\n\nLate at night and in the early morning hours, Christy Moreno, 39, a bilingual editorial director, squeezes a stress ball while sending work emails from her Kansas City, Missouri, home.\n\nHer makeshift office is a small round table in the corner of her dining room covered in stray crayons and device chargers. This single mother of two, ages 10 and 13, balances overseeing her children\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s education and counseling Latino parents working in hotels and restaurants on how to find child care. On social media, parent groups are overflowing with worry and confusion: What are families supposed to do?\n\nAnxieties are running especially high for parents whose children have health conditions that put them at higher risk for the coronavirus. Many can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t afford lower-risk options such as babysitters and nannies or having one parent stay home. These parents say even if they can find child care, they don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know if they should send their kids. Some employees can take sick leave or expanded family and medical leave if they are caring for a child when schools and day care centers are closed under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which was signed into law in March, but not everyone has that option.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faParents are being forced into this Catch-22,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 says Keri Rodrigues, founding president of the National Parents Union, a network of parent organizations across the country. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThey feel a desperate need to go back to work but at the same time they are terrified of this deadly virus.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nParents worry: Is it safe to send kids back to child care?\n\nLaid off in March, Rachel Jean-Pierre is a single mother of two in Union, New Jersey. If she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s called back to her job in New York City as a guest service manager in July, she will have to find a family member to help care for her children, ages 6 and 9, both of whom have asthma.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWith the government reopening the economy with no confirmed solution to this pandemic, I am torn between wanting my children to return to their normal schedules and wanting to keep them safe,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she says. \u201a\u00c4\u00faUntil the country has really grabbed hold of this pandemic, as a parent with children who suffer from asthma, I would rather be safe than sorry.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nConflicting messages have not helped parents make these tough calls. While President Donald Trump pushes governors to work to reopen schools, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned in Senate testimony last week, \"We don't know everything about this virus and we really better be pretty careful, particularly when it comes to children.\"\n\nIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s week 11 of quarantine for Naomi Nedd, a 49-year-old mother and contract negotiator for a managed care plan in Queens. She\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s resorted to bribing her 3-year-old son with gummy bears and screen time when she has to write a contract or jump on a Zoom call. Once he falls asleep at 7:30 pm, she digs in for hours to make a dent in her workload.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI went into this thinking, my kid is home, it will be fine. But it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s so different when you are trying to be the professional you are when you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve left your child at day care than when you are at a dining room table with a 3-year-old who just knows you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re mommy,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Nedd says.\n\nHer son is supposed to start a summer program in July and preschool in the fall, but her heart races just thinking about it. The ravages of the coronavirus are all around her at the epicenter of the New York outbreak. Children her son\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s age don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know how to socially distance.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI don't care what opens up, if my gut feels like it isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t safe, we will have to figure out a way to continue to make it work at home,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Nedd says.\n\nIn Boston, Yahaira Lopez, a 41-year-old mother of 10-year-old twins, one with ADHD, the other with autism, was recently laid off from her job on a mobile crisis team performing mental health risk assessments. She\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s struggling to be a substitute teacher to her two fourth graders, run Autism Sprinter, her nonprofit that helps the families and caregivers of children who are on the spectrum, and figure out how she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll afford rent and utilities.\n\nSchools are closed, summer programs are up in the air and Massachusetts has not yet reopened child care centers, she says. Even when these programs restart, Lopez says she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not sure she will send her kids. Both of her sons have severe asthma.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI would probably be very scared to send my children to any form of child care or after school program,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she says, \u201a\u00c4\u00faor, to be honest with you, even back to school into what may be overcrowded classrooms.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9"

Michael Flynn, in December 2016. Flynn, who was tapped to be President Donald Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s first national security adviser, was surveilled in conversation with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faSerious questions for Trumpers,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sherman wrote on Twitter last Friday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat is the scandal of unmasking an American official caught on an intercept discussing US sanctions policy with Ambassador of a hostile foreign country that had just launched a massive cyber attack on our election?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nUhh, he was the incoming National Security Advisor & a 3-star general. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s SUPPOSED to discuss sanctions policy. That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s his job. The unmasking was part of outgoing admin launching a massive sting operation to try to entrap him. Maybe this helps: imagine Bush doing same to Obama. https://t.co/ofKNYvrRKl \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) May 18, 2020\n\nSherman attempted to explain away the matter by suggesting that to unmask an American \u201a\u00c4\u00facaught\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 communicating with a foreign official of a hostile country is routine, even advisable. But the question frames the matter incorrectly. \u201a\u00c4\u00ec READ MORE\n\nListen to the insightful Thomas Paine Podcast Below --"

Opposition parties have requested the phone of far-right leader and his son Carlos to probe into the allegations levelled by former justice minister Sergio Moro that Bolsonaro tried to interfere in federal police investigations.\n\nA video of a cabinet meeting has been released on the order of Supreme Court justice in which the Brazilian President was seen using profane words to express his frustration at his inability to extract information from police. In the video, Bolsonaro can be heard vowing to change Cabinet ministers if it is needed to protect his family from the \u201a\u00c4\u00fafarce\u201a\u00c4\u00f9.\n\nMoro, one of the most popular figures in Bolsonaro administration, resigned last month after the Brazilian President fired the federal police director-general without consulting the Justice Minister. He alleged that Bolsonaro openly demanded changes in key federal police positions, including agency\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s chief.\n\nThe video was the latest blow to Bolsonaro\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s popularity which has nosedived after the coronavirus pandemic. Brazil has reported over 330,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases with more than 21,000 deaths related to the virus and is all set to topple Russia from the second position worldwide.\n\nRead: Man Accidentally Appears Naked During Zoom Conference Call With Bolsonaro\n\nOver 5.2 million cases\n\nAccording to the latest data of John Hopkins University, over 5.2 million coronavirus cases have been confirmed across the globe with over 338,000 deaths, overwhelming health care facilities worldwide. The United States, Russia, Brazil, and the UK are the worst-hit countries due to the pandemic with around 60 per cent of death toll reported from these four countries alone.\n\nThe numbers get more sombre for the US as it has reported over 1.6 million cases, almost one-third of the worldwide cases, and more than 96,000 deaths due to the infectious disease. Within the United States, New York has reported over one-fourth of the nationwide coronavirus cases and almost one-tenth of the worldwide cases.\n\nRead: COVID-19: Bolsonaro Says Brazil To Sign New Protocol Recommending Use Of Chloroquine\n\n(Image credit: AP)"

                        "article_content": "Original article written by Bill Sardi can be viewed on LewRockwell.com; the following is an excerpt which represents the author's opinion and does not necessarily reflect those of WHN:\n\nI penned a prior report, extrapolating from published flu studies, which predicts that 6/10ths-to-1.3% serious side effects after mandated coronavirus vaccination among the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 72.6 million senior adults would hospitalize 435,000-943,000 and a subsequent 1.4% mortality rate would then result in 54,202-111,493 deaths.\n\nThese hospitalizations and deaths are not necessarily caused by a vaccine, which is always pre-tested for safety among healthy adults who DO respond to vaccination by making antibodies, but from weak immunity among certain known risk groups.\n\nHere are four ways the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic could have already been brought to a \u201a\u00c4\u00fadead stop.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n1. Coronaviruses produce seasonal disease, running 5 months from November to the end of March. This is the period when the earth tilts away from the sun in northern latitudes resulting in less vitamin D production in human skin combined with colder weather that causes people to bundle up in clothing, which makes things worse. And what do health authorities demand the public do? Stay indoors under quarantine and prolong the agony of this unprecedented pandemic.\n\nIf you haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t noticed, quarantines don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t work. Look at the data from Italy (\u201a\u00c4\u00faAll of Italy Is In Lockdown As Coronavirus Cases Rise\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec CNN)\n\nAmericans must defy health authorities and go outside and bask in mid-day (10 AM to 2 PM) sunshine with skin exposed. Some of the news media ridicules individuals who ignore orders to stay indoors, inciting fear by reporting death counts that are only normal for the season and may not even be caused by coronavirus. ( NOTE: WHN is not recommending breaking any orders, and it is possible to stay inside and open a window/door to bask in the sun.)\n\nOnly a few infectious disease investigators have noted climatic conditions (cold temperature) drives people indoors (as do quarantines) that not only reduce vitamin D blood levels but also increase disease severity.\n\nCoronaviruses are believed to be in circulation through the rest of the year but sunshine vitamin D keeps them from erupting. The man who is running the CDC, keeps pushing for prolongation of the quarantine/lockdown that is literally priming the disease. That same man said, before Congress, Covid-19 coronavirus is \u201a\u00c4\u00fa10 times more lethal than seasonal flu.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 But was quoted four days later in the New England Journal of Medicine to say \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1%\u201a\u00c4\u00b6.. and may be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nForcing people indoors increases transmission of seasonal viruses by 18.7 times compared to open-air environments. This information is contained in a report issued by the CDC itself [Emerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 26, June 2020]. Obviously, the left hand doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know what the right hand is doing at the CDC.\n\nWhile the world awaits a coronavirus vaccine, vitamin D is many times more effective than the flu vaccine. These discoveries have not been embraced by public health authorities.\n\nThere is also strong evidence that many virally-infected patients also have tuberculosis, particularly in foreign-born immigrants. TB is also a seasonal lung infection, like cold and flu viruses (i.e. coronavirus). Vitamin D is a known antidote for TB.\n\nGiven that coronavirus infection threatens high-risk individuals, a more targeted vitamin D supplementation campaign among diabetics, obese individuals, tobacco smokers and alcohol imbibers would likely serve to reduce cases of infection as well as subsequent hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nIt would cost society far less to target high-risk groups with the provision of vitamin D supplements and even sun lamp therapy than it would to vaccinate masses of people who will never be infected or hospitalized.\n\nPharmacies seeing patients who fit high-risk criteria could hand out free bottles of vitamin D provided by the government or at least recommend vitamin D to every patient.\n\nVaccines aren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t reliable prevention for high-risk individuals who don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t efficiently produce antibodies. Vitamin D therapy would represent true prevention. The Centers for Disease Control purchases vaccines from pharmaceutical manufacturers and could do the same for vitamin D. Of course, this would be anathema to physicians. Dispensing from pharmacies would likely be more do-able.\n\nInfluenza costs ~$10.4 billion a year for hospitalizations, doctor visits, vaccines and medicines. The provision of vitamin D pills during the 5 months of the cold and flu season for the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 12 million senior adults aged 80+, considered the highest risk group, would cost just ~$200 million and would likely prevent billions of dollars of disease and death.\n\n2. According to various reports, about 2-in-10 to 3-in-10 of coronavirus cases occur among health care and hospital personnel. The Centers for Disease Control does recommend healthcare personnel be provided respirators or masks. But after many years of drafting plans to fight seasonal flu outbreaks and epidemics, the CDC was caught unprepared. Masks and respirators are in short supply. What is needed are N-95 (0.3-micron filter) respirators, which are not available.\n\nAn alternative would be to use N95 respirators and N95 masks intended for industrial purposes, which are available, and adapt them for medical use.\n\nHere the nation is 3 months into its battle against seasonal flu and COVID-19 coronavirus, and it is just now figuring out how to supply n95 masks and respirators to healthcare personnel. Be aware, some studies show N95 respirators compared to N95 masks reduce illness from 17% to just 6.2%. However, this was for transmission of bacteria, not viruses like coronavirus. However, as stated by Dr. Lawrence Broxmeyer, a great deal of the infectious lung disease now being treated is caused by a bacterium \u201a\u00c4\u00ec tuberculosis.\n\nIf the public health agencies and hospitals can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t provide ambulance paramedics, nurses and ancillary health personnel proper protection, maybe we need crowdfunding by the public to buy them N95 respirators, so in case we do have to go to the hospital, we don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have the disease transmitted from doctor/nurse to patient.\n\n3. The lack of any approved drug or vaccine for coronavirus has prompted the search for natural non-prescription remedies. The trace mineral zinc is one of the natural remedies that have been revealed in this coronavirus pandemic as an antidote to coronavirus infection.\n\nIt has been demonstrated that the trace mineral zinc inhibits the replication of coronavirus in infected cells via its ability to block RNA synthesis. Coronaviruses are RNA viruses.\n\nDrugs that improve zinc utilization and facilitate zinc entry in cells, such as chloroquine, have now become well known for their ability to quell coronavirus infections. To prove the underlying mechanism that makes this drug work, chelation (removal) of zinc reverses this effect.\n\nThe President of the United States declared chloroquine, used to treat malaria, a \u201a\u00c4\u00fagodsend,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 which was quickly pounced upon by political opponents and given widespread news coverage. But the FDA just now issued emergency approval of chloroquine for coronavirus.\n\nQuercetin, an extract from red apples, and EGCG from green tea are also zinc ionophores (binders) like chloroquine.\n\nFew physicians realize that unbound (free) bioavailable zinc is kept at a low level by binding to its carrier (metallothionein). The trace mineral selenium induces release of zinc from its binder, facilitating more bioavailable zinc.\n\nIf the public catches on, zinc could replace vaccines.\n\n4. Diligent physicians who treat volumes of patients can accelerate research as there is no time to wait for results from clinical trials. There is no time for peer review. To avoid needless deaths, real-time work-in-progress studies can fast-track clinical data needed by medical personnel worldwide.\n\nOne such example is that of Vladimir Zelenko in New York who reports an unusually high coronavirus infection rate of 65% among the first 200 patients tested. The successful use of the therapeutic triad of an antibiotic (azithromycin), an autoimmune drug (hydroxychloroquine) and zinc sulfate among 699 infected patients has resulted in zero deaths, zero need for respirators with just 4 patients admitted to the hospital; in other words, zero death rate. Of note, both azithromycin and chloroquine are used to treat tuberculosis.\n\nNotice the central role zinc is playing in the prevention and treatment of coronavirus. Zinc has only come out of the closet as a last resort. Yet it has been available for decades. Studies involving zinc lozenges have produced mixed results, but it has been noted that only zinc acetate lozenges that deliver a given amount of zinc have been found effective. Most zinc lozenges on the market do not deliver sufficient dosage to quell a viral infection. About 75-92 milligrams a day has been shown to be effective when given in a slow-release lozenge.\n\nIt is difficult to come to any other conclusion than that public health agencies aren't exactly operating in the public\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s best interest. In fact, either by issuance of bad policies and health edicts or neglect of less problematic and more economical remedies, Americans can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t rely on public health agencies for the best advice on how to avoid or treat coronavirus infections.\n\nGiven that the news media parrots health policies to the public without question says Americans are being delivered nothing but high-end propaganda and need to obtain health information from other sources. Don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t listen to politicians who complain about a lack of hospital ventilators. According to one emergency room physician, 70-90% of virally infected patients with pneumonia that are placed on ventilators die. Ventilators are a last-ditch effort to buy time and hope for a cure. Americans will have to cure the coronavirus epidemic on their own.\n\nFear will be played to the hilt now to coerce the population into forced vaccination and 100% monitoring of our whereabouts, which was the objective of the plannedemic from the beginning. Because fear trumps information and logic."

                        "article_content": "Advertisement\n\nAs a first-time mother with no idea what to expect, Nancy Pedroza was convinced the hospital was the safest place to have her baby.\n\nThat conviction turned to doubt when in late March most U.S. states ordered residents to stay home and hospitals and doctors began taking new precautions to protect pregnant women and their babies against the novel coronavirus sweeping the nation.\n\nPedroza holds on to Morgan as she experiences contractions while taking a brisk walk with Nichollette Jones, her doula, to speed up Pedroza's contractions. So, at 40 weeks pregnant, she turned to a midwife to help her have a home birth. She and her partner Ryan Morgan were about to become parents in the middle of a pandemic. \"Thing were changing so fast,\" said Pedroza, 27, who lives with her partner at her parents' house in Fort Worth, Texas. She had to go alone to all her visits with her obstetrician where before she had brought either Morgan, her father or a doula, a birth assistant.\n\nPedroza lies on a bed in front of Jones, Taylor and Morgan as he helps to pump her breastmilk to try and speed up her contractions. But what really scared her was the uncertainty of who would be allowed to stand by her side at the hospital when the baby came into the world. She would have to choose between Morgan and her doula. The hospital would allow only one and warned her the policy could change and it might bar all visitors. \"It was scary to feel like I might have to do it alone,\" she said, noting that the doctors and nurses were not the same as those who had supported her throughout her pregnancy. \"It's nothing like having someone there that you care about and cares about you that's willing to hold your hand and tell you this is going to be OK.\"\n\nPedroza attends an appointment with her licensed midwives Susan Taylor who checks her stomach, and Amanda Prouty in Taylor's home office at her house. As COVID-19 puts the globe on pause and changes every aspect of daily life, women are entering motherhood with a mixture of anxiety, fear and frustration. Some countries, although not the United States, have banned everyone from the delivery room. Others are separating women who become sick from their newborns. By early April, with her baby past due and learning Medicaid would not cover a home birth, Pedroza considered giving birth at home without any medical assistance.\n\nPedroza experiences contractions. She got in touch with midwife Susan Taylor on Facebook, who not only lowered her fee but offered up her own home when Pedroza's mother became uneasy about the idea of her grandchild being born in her bathroom or bedroom. But Pedroza was running out of time. Legally the midwife had to transfer Pedroza's care to a hospital if she went past 42 weeks of pregnancy. A sonogram showed the baby's fluid levels were low, which can cause complications during birth.\n\nPedroza is supported by Jones and Morgan as she experiences contractions while laboring. After a membrane sweep, visit to a chiropractor, a brisk walk and using a breast pump to stimulate labor, the contractions started. After laboring several hours in a birthing tub in Taylor's home, Pedroza started pushing but the baby's heart rate suddenly dropped from 130 to 30, so the midwives called an ambulance.\n\nPedroza experiences contractions as she is placed onto an ambulance stretcher to be taken to hospital by paramedics. Masked emergency workers put Pedroza onto a stretcher and wheeled her to an ambulance that took her and Morgan to Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Southwest around 1 a.m. Taylor rode with her in the ambulance, monitoring the baby's heartbeat.\n\nPedroza is carried into an ambulance on a stretcher, to be taken to hospital. But once at the hospital, her midwives had to leave. \"Once I got the epidural administered and calmed me down a little bit and realizing I'd still be able to do this myself without possibly having a C-section and hearing the baby's heartbeat on the monitor it brought me so much comfort that I didn't care I was at the hospital at that point,\" said Pedroza, who worked as a massage therapist before becoming pregnant.\n\nProuty watches 2-day old footage of the birth of Kai Rohan Morgan, recorded by his father Ryan, of Pedroza giving birth. After laboring with a mask on for hours, at 5:55 a.m. on April 8 a healthy baby boy named Kai Rohan Morgan was born, weighing 8 pounds and 5 ounces. The hospital gave her and Morgan masks to wear anytime someone entered their room. Some staff also wore masks and gloves when they helped with breast feeding and took their vital signs.\n\nTaylor takes two-day old Kai's temperature while checking if he has tongue tie, an oral condition that can potentially cause issues with feeding, during a newborn screening at the house of Kai's maternal grandparents.\n\nStory \"It's already kind of scary thinking that it's a possibility that you're going to be in an environment that is contaminated or that puts you at risk or your baby at risk,\" Pedroza said. \"What puts me on edge more is seeing everyone with that attire and being very adamant about wearing it.\""

According to them, the virus remains highly stable for a long time at a temperature of about +4 degrees Celsius. In the absence of disinfection, its activity begins to decline only after 14 days.\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 is very sensitive to high temperatures: it dies within five minutes at +70 \u00ac\u221eC. At +56 \u00ac\u221e C, the virus remains active for less than half an hour, at +37 degrees - for no more than two days, and at a temperature of 22 degrees - for about a week.\n\nScientists find how long coronavirus can live on various surfaces\n\nOn the outer side of medical masks the virus lives for at least a week at room temperature and relative humidity of 65 percent. Coronavirus stays on paper for less than three hours, on wooden surfaces and fabrics - for not more than two days, on glass - for less than four days, on stainless steel and plastic - for no longer than a week.\n\n\n\nIt is worthy of note that reusable face masks made of fabric, which many people tend to use nowadays instead of disposable medical masks (or due to the shortage of them) can be used repeatedly only after meticulous disinfection. As with disposable medical masks, cloth masks need to be changed every two to three hours of constant use.\n\nAt home, cloth masks need to be washed with soap or detergent and then treated with a steam generator or steam iron.\n\nAfter disinfection, one should press the mask with hot iron without steaming it to kill all the germs that can live in moist fabric.\n\nAs medical specialists all over the world emphasize, such masks are intended primarily for sick individuals in the first place. They can be effective only in combination with other prophylactic measures (avoiding contact, frequent washing of hands, disinfection of items and surfaces, etc.). In addition, the mask should be worn by people who provide medical care for sick individuals.\n\n\n\nHealthy people can wear the mask when visiting public places, using public transport, but the effectiveness of the mask in such situations has not been proven. Disposable medical masks made of non-woven material should not be reused or disinfected.\n\nCoronavirus pandemic to end this summer?\n\nSpecialists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that 90% of cases of COVID-19 infection occurred at temperatures ranging from 3 to 17\u00ac\u221eC and absolute humidity from 4 to 9 g/m\u00ac\u2265. If their assumption is correct, warm and humid weather in the coming months may improve the situation in many countries of the Northern Hemisphere, whereas the situation in the countries of the Southern Hemisphere may worsen. However, this does not mean that coronavirus will not spread in countries with warm and humid climate.\n\n\n\nFor example, in Thailand, where temperatures remain at about 30 degrees Centigrade all the year round, coronavirus remains active and tough measures to combat it. At the same time, the novel virus is now actively spreading in Syria and turkey, where temperatures already near +25C. Some specialists believe that climate shows no influence on the new coronavirus as it has spread on all continents, except Antarctica. This is just an observation as there is still no scientific base to explain the nature of the new coronavirus."

                        "article_content": "Transforming America into a country that runs on clean energy is one way experts hope to alleviate the devastating economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. With unemployment soaring and oil prices in a free fall, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s looking highly unlikely that the US will simply step back into \u201a\u00c4\u00fabusiness as usual.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Even though the pandemic is still raging, policy experts, climate action advocates, and scientists have all started drawing up plans that could save Americans from both the ravages of climate change and the economic fallout of COVID-19.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faRight now is the ideal time to be investing in renewable energy\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faRight now is the ideal time to be investing in renewable energy that can produce millions of family-sustaining wage jobs across the United States,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 says Mark Paul, a political economist at New College of Florida.\n\nPaul is one of the co-authors of a $2 trillion \u201a\u00c4\u00fagreen stimulus\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 that aims to create millions of jobs by dramatically expanding renewable energy capacity and retooling the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s infrastructure for the transition away from fossil fuels. Smaller plans have also grown at state and local levels. A petition coming out of New York asks for $500 billion to help states with budget shortfalls and expand clean energy.\n\nThe basic idea is that federal spending on a cleaner future would put Americans back to work, shift the balance of power away from polluting industries with big lobbying budgets, and meet key deadlines for climate action that scientists say are necessary to limit the damage done by climate change.\n\nRenewables like solar and wind create more jobs per unit of energy delivered than coal or natural gas, a 2010 study published in the journal Energy Policy found. While $1 million in stimulus spending on oil and natural gas generated roughly five jobs, the same amount would result in 13 to 14 jobs in wind and solar, a 2009 report found.\n\nsolar and wind create more jobs per unit of energy delivered than coal or natural gas\n\nThose numbers were crunched as the policymakers tried to figure out how to rebound from a different economic crisis \u201a\u00c4\u00ee the 2008 Great Recession. Paul says one lesson learned from the Great Recession is that it isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t too early to start planning ahead. After all, the climate crisis is expected to take its own toll on the global economy. Weaning the planet off the fossil fuels that are heating it up could help nip that financial crisis in the bud.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe biggest challenge for COVID now will be managing the return to work, but then having work to go back to that opens up real opportunities \u201a\u00c4\u00ee and that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s what this clean energy investment would do,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 says Daniel Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley and a co-author of the green stimulus proposal and the 2010 paper in Energy Policy.\n\nThe threats posed by climate change make the transition to renewables more urgent than ever. As technology advanced and the cost of making and installing solar panels has dropped, renewable energy became a bigger part of the US energy mix. The Obama-era stimulus package that included a $90 billion investment in clean energy also gave the industry a boost over the past decade.\n\nYet despite expanding rapidly since 2008, renewables still only made up 11 percent of US energy consumption in 2018. That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not nearly enough if the US wants to meet the targets laid out in the Paris Agreement that scientists say are necessary to avoid catastrophic effects of climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels need to be cut nearly in half from 2010 levels by 2030, according to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nTo tackle the climate crisis, we need to clean up our energy system over the next 15 years. The narwhal curve shows us the challenge\u201a\u00c4\u00eeand the opportunity.\n\n\n\nThrilled to share this video based on my new book, Short Circuiting Policy.pic.twitter.com/vcS9hpKvVm \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Leah Stokes (@leahstokes) April 27, 2020\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are not moving fast enough on renewable energy and the stimulus is an amazing opportunity to move faster,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Leah Stokes, an assistant professor at UC Santa Barbara and author of the new book, Short Circuiting Policy: Interest Groups and the Battle Over Clean Energy and Climate Policy in the American States. If the US powers its electricity and transportation sectors entirely with renewables, that would slash its carbon emissions by more than half, Stokes proposes.\n\nJobs wouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t just come from building new solar and wind farms. To support the influx of energy from renewables, the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s energy grid would need to grow twice as large, she says. America\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s grid was built to support fossil fuels; power is generated at centralized locations and then travels long distances over transmission lines to power peoples\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 homes and businesses. Renewable energy generation, on the other hand, is distributed more widely. There\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s also the issue of intermittency: the amount of energy coming into the grid from wind and solar farms across the US can vary with the weather. So an updated and expanded grid needs to be able to get excess renewable energy generated in one location to other places that need it.\n\nGetting all of that done is a massive undertaking that would require a lot of boots on the ground. Paul argues that clean energy can offer a new career path for many of the millions of people who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve lost their jobs recently. The distributed nature of renewables also means they have the potential to employ people locally across all 50 states, rather than tying jobs to regions with rich oil, gas, or coal deposits.\n\nThe number of jobs in solar and wind are expected to grow rapidly through 2028, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Solar panel system installers and wind turbine technicians are the fastest growing occupations in the country. The number of people in each occupation was expected to climb by 63 percent and 57 percent respectively by 2028, but that was before the pandemic hit. Now, the industry will need some support from governments to keep that momentum going.\n\nNew York state, despite being the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic in the US, is still betting on renewables to help it recover from the pandemic and avert more crises caused by climate change. In April, it passed a measure to speed up the siting process for new renewable energy projects as part of its 2020-2021 budget, even as other budget items fell by the wayside because of the economic crunch caused by the virus.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faKeeping us on track [for climate targets] will be a driver of construction jobs. It will be an opportunity to help the broader state economy get back on track with what was already a fast growing sector,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 says Alicia Barton, president and CEO of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHopefully if we can think smartly about things the state can do and potentially see investments from the federal government, we have a good opportunity to seize a challenging moment and turn it into a moment of opportunity.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faKeeping us on track [for climate targets] will be a driver of construction jobs.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nWhile there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s opportunity, there are also significant roadblocks. States like New York, which already had ambitious plans to scale up renewable energy but was also hard hit by the pandemic, shed thousands of clean energy jobs since the pandemic started. Projects are languishing during stay-at-home orders. More than half of American solar workers were either laid off or faced cutbacks, according to an April survey by the Solar Energy Industries Association. Thirty-five thousand jobs and $35 billion in investments in wind energy are jeopardized by the COVID-19 pandemic, the American Wind Energy Association reports.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unfortunately safe to say that we are going to be headed into a pretty deep economic downturn, even when our economies slowly open up,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 says Noah Kaufman, a researcher at Columbia University. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThese are things that are going to be very bad for all industries including the renewable industry. Spending is going to be down; it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll be harder to get financing.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe best thing that the government can do for the economy is work to rev the economy back up to full speed as quickly as possible through deficit spending,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Paul says. Skeptics of proposals like a Green New Deal have balked at the price tag of retooling the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s energy infrastructure. But the economic disaster following the pandemic has squashed much of the political aversion to deficit spending \u201a\u00c4\u00ee the question now is how to spend that money.\n\nmore hurdles for clean energy growth\n\nThe question of how to best spend deficit money will be hashed out by politicians, and that presents even more hurdles for continued clean energy growth. Renewable industries\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 asks of the federal government have so far been pretty modest. They\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve pushed for an extension of tax credits that expire this year, which they could miss out on as projects are stalled. Republicans and fossil fuel lobbyists have sought to block even that, as the Trump administration has prioritized boosting coal, oil, and natural gas.\n\nAnd while states, cities, and the private sector had stepped up to cut their greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re now tightening purse strings \u201a\u00c4\u00ee which could stymie renewable energy growth and other efforts to take action on climate change.\n\nTo top it all off, the $2 trillion green stimulus proposed by Paul and others patches together policy recommendations from Democratic candidates who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve dropped from the presidential race \u201a\u00c4\u00ee so it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unlikely that the proposal will pick up enough steam at the federal level to be put in action while Republicans are in charge. A lot will ride on the outcome of November elections.\n\nIf the plan did actually become reality, it would be more of an extended recovery plan instead of a quick injection of money. Paul and others who crafted the proposal write that their $2 trillion plan \u201a\u00c4\u00fafocuses on the longer-term challenge of jumpstarting economic recovery and transitioning to a more sustainable economy.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBut in an economic emergency like this one, speed does need to play a role. Even with the long-term goal of decarbonization, a stimulus needs to quickly put money in the hands of people who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll spend it, Kaufman explains. That ought to inform what kinds of energy and infrastructure projects should move forward as part of any kind of plan to boost the economy.\n\nBuilding a high-speed renewable-energy rail line across the country, for example, could create jobs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation \u201a\u00c4\u00ee but it could also get mired in permitting and legal issues for years. On the other hand, grants or subsidies for shovel-ready solar and wind projects and funding for energy-efficiency retrofits would get federal dollars to people much faster. More localized renewable energy projects are also quicker to get off the ground, in general, than new oil and gas infrastructure like pipelines that cross state borders and often get held up in court for years, Kammen at Berkeley says.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faClean energy really has a leg up, certainly over dirty energy.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBeyond getting people back to work, clean energy spending solves other problems. It would curb air pollution that burdened certain communities with more preexisting health conditions and made them particularly vulnerable to the novel coronavirus. And by cutting out fossil fuels, the US avoids scenarios where the climate crisis could cost the US economy hundreds of billions of dollars each year by 2090. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt would be silly to design a stimulus package and not also try to have the spending lead to long term benefits. All else equal, you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d much rather build a bridge than have people dig ditches and then fill them in again,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kaufman adds. \u201a\u00c4\u00faFrom that regard, I think, clean energy really has a leg up, certainly over dirty energy.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis can be looked at as a canary in the coal mine, says Eric Orts, professor at Wharton and director of the business school\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Initiative for Global Environmental Leadership. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOne thing we can do is learn from this so that with respect to climate change we don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t do the same thing that we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve just done with respect to the coronavirus, which is fail to listen to the scientists, fail to change, fail to get ready.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9"

The problem is, however, that there is currently a limited amount of dogs.\n\nThe United Kingdom is facing a surging demand for dogs amid the lockdown, which has led to a shortage and even a doubling in price for some popular breeds, The Financial Times reported.\n\nBill Lambert, head of health and welfare at the Kennel Club, which operates the national register of pedigree dogs, told the newspaper that inquiries for puppies through the club increased 140 percent in April compared with last year, while waiting lists for puppies have increased fourfold.\n\nThe report suggests that French Bulldogs are among the most popular breeds right now and that the prices for dogs are ramping up, with numerous canines being trafficked into the country from Europe.\n\nCC0 French bulldog\n\nIn the meantime, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals reported a 600 percent increase in visits to its dog fostering pages, as people are trying to find a furry companion.\n\nAt the same time, British charities have warned that many dogs might be returned to shelters after the end of the quarantine, as many are not ready to take care of them for a long time, and some will experience difficulties with their puppies when they have to return to work."

To those of you suffering and grieving,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the county\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said during a Thursday afternoon briefing, \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe offer our deepest condolences. We are thinking of you and your families every single day.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe county also announced 1,204 new cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, bringing the total number of infections so far to 42,307.\n\nThe mid-day total did not include updated numbers for Pasadena and Long Beach. Both cities have their own health departments, unlike every other city in the county, and have been managing their own local response to COVID-19. Long Beach reported three new deaths, bringing the city\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s total to 68, and 95 new cases for a total of 1,495. Pasadena reported six new cases, for a total of 790 and two new deaths, for a total of 79.\n\nOf the newly reported deaths in LA County, 28 were over the age of 65, 20 of whom had underlying health conditions; 12 were between the ages of 41 and 65, 10 of whom had underlying health conditions. County officials did not have details on the six remaining fatalities other than to say three occurred in Long Beach, and the other three happened in Pasadena.\n\nOf all of the people who have died in the county from coronavirus-related causes, about 39% were Latino, 29% were white, 17% were Asian, 12% were African American, 1% were Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander and 1% identified as another race.\n\nAbout 92% of people who have died after testing positive for COVID-19 have had underlying health conditions.\n\nMore than 403,000 COVID-19 tests have been administered in the county, Ferrer said, and about 9% of those people have tested positive for the virus.\n\nAs Los Angeles County moves forward with lifting closures that were intended to stem the spread of the coronavirus, Ferrer said officials are keeping a close eye on the number of cases and deaths, as well as indicators like hospital capacity and the availability of personal protective equipment for frontline workers.\n\nMost of those measures are headed in the right direction, she said. The transmission rate has declined from one person with the virus infecting about three other people to one person with the virus infecting one other person on average, she said.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is very good news, and it shows that what we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re doing over past few weeks \u201a\u00c4\u00ee staying home, physical distancing, wearing our cloth face coverings \u201a\u00c4\u00ee has resulted in a reduced number of infections from what we would have had had we not taken any action.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe average number of deaths per day is also shrinking, and officials are meeting their target for contact tracing, which is to follow up with every new case within one day of receiving that information, Ferrer said.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faAs a community, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve done this together,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faand this progress is a direct reflection of what all of you in your day-to-day lives have been able to accomplish.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nMoving forward, she said, it will be important for people to continue taking those precautions as they take advantage of opportunities to get outside.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faAs we hike our trails, go to our beaches and use our other outdoor spaces, we can all take responsibility for creating safety for the people who work at those sites and others who are using these spaces,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI know we can do this. Of this I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m certain because we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve done it. We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve worked together. We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been doing our part, and we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve saved lives as a result.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9"

See:\n\nSince that time, we have reported on how many doctors and hospitals here in the U.S. have also successfully used the treatment. See:\n\nNow, a doctor in Michigan has actually had his clinic raided by the FBI and arrested being accused of \u201a\u00c4\u00facommitting health care fraud and conspiracy to commit health care fraud\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 because he treated his patients with Vitamin C.\n\nMichigan Doctor Charged with Felonies for Treating Coronavirus Patients with Vitamin C\n\nby Shane Trejo\n\nBig League Politics\n\nExcerpts:\n\nA Michigan doctor has had his Metro Detroit clinic raided following allegations that he was \u201a\u00c4\u00faillegally\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 treating coronavirus patients with Vitamin C.\n\nDr. Charles Mok, who leads the Allure Medical Spa in Shelby Township, has been accused of committing health care fraud and conspiracy to commit health care fraud. He is being charged in federal court for these supposed crimes.\n\nMok is an advocate for treating coronavirus patients with Vitamin C in order to boost their immune systems while they fight off the virus. This has become a controversial notion, as hysteria proponents stand in the way of any treatment that does not involve forcing vaccine shots into millions of people.\n\nFederal jackboots surrounded the Allure facility and raided it last week. They are claiming that his treatments do not qualify for Medicare reimbursements because they have not been rubber-stamped for approval by the Medical Mafia at the FDA. He is also being accused of conducting illegal vein treatment after all \u201a\u00c4\u00fanon-essential businesses\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 were forced to close by an edict from Governor Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nMok announced on YouTube that \u201a\u00c4\u00faIV vitamin C is being used in hospitals across the country to treat the most advanced disease associated with COVID-19.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 This may have prompted the feds to shut down his operation by brute force.\n\nRead the Full Article at Big League Politics"

                        "article_content": "If you were given this bed when you went to the hospital, would that make you concerned?\n\nNot gonna lie, I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d be a little worried.\n\nDuring this pandemic, some people have taken the opportunity to create some new products to help with the fight against the virus that has caused global lockdowns and over 300,000 deaths worldwide.\n\nOnline platforms like Zoom and GoToMeeting have adjusted their platforms for high-demand use so that more people can work remotely and have kids continue the school year with online classes. We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve discovered that while it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s clearly not for everyone, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not so bad.\n\nTrending: After \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Suffering In Hell\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 During His COVID Treatment Coma, Drummer Rejects Satanic Beliefs\n\nWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve seen actual innovation, though. Just a couple of examples include the doctors in Oregon who created a 3D printed ventilator for $10 and an app that helps with \u201a\u00c4\u00fasocial distancing\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 by limiting the number of customers in stores by creating \u201a\u00c4\u00favirtual queues.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a win-win for businesses and consumers.\n\nBut some \u201a\u00c4\u00fainnovations\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 just sound like a bad idea from the get-go.\n\nLike this cardboard hospital bed that can be turned into a coffin. It is specifically designed for COVID patients.\n\nA factory in Colombia is making hospital beds that can be turned into a coffin if the patient dies These dual-purpose beds are designed for #COVID19 patients All the latest #coronavirus news here \uf8ff\u00fc\u00eb\u00e1https://t.co/VAjyXIw6P2 pic.twitter.com/1SoZmzDoeZ \u201a\u00c4\u00ee The Telegraph (@Telegraph) May 14, 2020\n\nWould you let your loved one be put in that?\n\nNow, I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not against a sign company looking to meet a need in the community and repurpose their facility for that.\n\nBUT\u201a\u00c4\u00b6 there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s just so much wrong with this.\n\nFirst, having a hospital bed that converts into a coffin is just ghoulish. We don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t send people to the hospital expecting them to die. There is no hope left when someone is put in a bed that could instantly be converted into their coffin.\n\nSecond, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s made of cardboard. That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s dehumanizing. This isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t a small pet that you bury in the backyard in a shoebox, these are human beings not Speedy the Wonder Hamster that your third-grader is crying over.\n\nRemind me, what happens when cardboard gets wet? Because that could be a problem. You clearly can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t clean someone on this thing, and what about feeding? What happens if someone spills water on it? The biggest problem that I see is that the body itself contains fluids like blood, saliva, sputum, urine, and other things, all of which can spread disease. Even if this thing was treated to be \u201a\u00c4\u00fawaterproof\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d have to toss it the minute bodily fluids touched it and in a hospital setting that would be in pretty short order.\n\nThis is a clear case of \u201a\u00c4\u00fadidn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think that one through\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00fadidn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t consult with a single medical professional.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBut you know that morons in government are going to see this as a brilliant and much-needed innovation in the midst of a pandemic.\n\nSpeaking of morons in government\u201a\u00c4\u00b6\n\nThese bed/coffin combo units might be Governor Cuomo\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s new state-mandated nursing home beds\u201a\u00c4\u00ecbecause that completely fits with his policies. Maybe he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll add in blankets that can double as a body-bag since he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s already sending body bags to nursing homes.\n\n[Quick Update from the author: I think I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m being unfair to Governor Cuomo who has rescinded his disastrous policy that forces nursing homes to take COVID-positive patients now that thousands of people senselessly died. I should also include the other governors who sent COVID-positive patients into nursing homes but have not rescinded the order like New Jersey\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Phil Murphy and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, as well as those simply covering up the data like California\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Gavin Newsom.]\n\nNote to the creators of this horrific hospital bed/coffin hybrid\u201a\u00c4\u00b6\n\nJust because you can do something, doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t mean that you should do it."

A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s measures of success. But after a manic 3\u00ac\u03a9 years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.\n\nBy far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not going to play that game,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not uniform across states and across countries.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBut even beyond the death count, there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the official said.\n\nSome Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t been able to focus on getting the response right.\n\nTrump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSo it is a war and I define victory when it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said on May 1. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt can never be a total victory because too many people have died.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nWhen American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.\n\nOthers are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAllowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 argued one Republican close to the president.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sen. Lindsey Graham\n\nBut, he added, \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf things don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t look like they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re bouncing back by September, I think that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to be a problem.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe fear that Trump can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.\n\nWhen asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the \u201a\u00c4\u00faeconomic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nA spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.\n\nOthers are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)"

And Edgar County became the 100th county to record positive cases in the state.\n\nThere have been 90,369 confirmed coronavirus cases since the pandemic began.\n\nThe state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s overall positivity rate \u201a\u00c4\u00ee the number of positive cases compared to total tests received \u201a\u00c4\u00ee was 9.1%.

Queens, by comparison, added only 336 cases over the same time frame to bring its total to 58,084.\n\nCook County still has a lower rate of COVID-19 per capita given its population (5.1 million) is more than twice as large as Queens (2.25 million). But Queens also has a much higher population density with 20,500 people per square mile compared to 5,500 per square mile in Cook County, which can make social distancing measures more challenging to maintain.\n\n1:55 p.m. Lightfoot hints at street closures to help restaurants\n\nIs Mayor Lori Lightfoot planning to close streets and sidewalks so restaurants can safely reopen and give residents a place to run, walk and play? Sure sounds like it.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faPeople are itching to get outside. Businesses are looking at creative ways to serve customers. The key is how we do it,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the mayor tweeted Friday.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faStay tuned for some changes to our streets and sidewalks. Transportation is more than just cars. We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll show how Chicago can be safer and easier to get around.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nLast week, Illinois Restaurant Association President Sam Toia urged Gov. J.B. Pritzker to relax his five-step plan to reopen Illinois by allowing restaurants to open at 25% of capacity beginning June 1 with strict safeguards for restaurant employees, including face masks and daily temperature checks.\n\nAt the time, Toia teased the street closing idea.\n\nRead the full report from Fran Spielman here.\n\n1:27 p.m. Lightfoot warns religious leaders she is prepared to enforce stay-at-home order\n\nMayor Lori Lightfoot has appealed to religious leaders to not defy Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s stay-at-home order \u201a\u00c4\u00ee and warned she is prepared to \u201a\u00c4\u00faenforce the rules\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 if they don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t.\n\nIn a \u201a\u00c4\u00faDear Members of the Chicago Faith Community\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 letter sent Thursday, Lightfoot urged religious leaders to continue holding virtual services rather than in-person services, where it is difficult, if not impossible, to maintain social distance.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI am urging you to stay the course. If there is a problem, I would rather be in conversation than in conflict. But to be clear, I am resolute that I must enforce the rules of the governor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s stay-at-home order. To be fair to all, I simply cannot look away from non-compliance, no matter the source or the intention,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she wrote.\n\nOn Monday, Lightfoot responded to Sunday service defiance by saying she hoped to educate religious leaders into compliance, avoiding mass arrests.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not gonna send in the police to arrest parishioners. People are exercising their faith, and I understand that,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said then.\n\nBut the next day, the mayor made it clear she was serious about enforcing the governor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s order and she would do what she must.\n\nRead the full report from Fran Spielman here.\n\n12:59 p.m. Cubs chairman Tom Ricketts not sure baseball will be played this season: report\n\nCubs chairman Tom Ricketts told season-ticket holders he is not sure baseball will be played this year.\n\nAccording to a story published by The Athletic, Ricketts said the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, conflicts over the best time to reopen businesses, and continuing negotiations between the owners and players could combine to prevent the start of the season.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think anyone can answer that question just yet,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ricketts said during a virtual forum with season-ticket holders Thursday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe current thinking and the current discussions (among owners) have been all around trying to get back into our home ballparks for this season.

She is vision-impaired, hearing-impaired, arthritic and suffering from mild dementia, certainly, but for 13 years in two homes she had largely been able to avoid hospital stays for life-threatening problems. Plus, her interaction with me seemed to greatly help in minimizing her spells of confusion.\n\nBut now, during our relatively brief period of enforced separation \u201a\u00c4\u00ee I live on a lower floor while she lives up on an assisted living floor \u201a\u00c4\u00ee she has contracted pneumonia, for which she has been in and out of hospital, and her spells of confusion seem to be worsening. Symptomatic, doubtless, of the unprecedented disorientation.\n\nMy mother remains among the living today, but for how long if she remains so isolated? Now multiply this single case by all the other seniors around the country who have seen their precious interactive routines disappear. It is a situation that many of them, given their cognitive limitations, have difficulty grasping.\n\nThis potentially lethal hardship is worth noting when we are formulating pandemic recovery plans. The cure of the quarantine shouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t cost more than the contagion itself, should it?\n\nRead this and more letters here.\n\n11:44 a.m. What\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the first meal you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll want at a restaurant post-pandemic? We asked, Chicagoans answered.\n\nWith eat-in dining at restaurants on hold because of the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s coronavirus stay-at-home order, the next time you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll be waited on at a restaurant probably won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be for a while.\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s five-phase plan for reopening Illinois businesses puts restaurant reopenings in Phase 4. We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re now in Phase 2.\n\nSo with Chicagoans craving a meal out, we asked: Once restaurants reopen for dining in, what\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the first meal you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll want to eat out, and from where? Some of these answers have been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faBreakfast at a Greek joint: feta cheese-and-spinach omelet, hashbrowns and an English muffin or pancakes.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Rose Panieri\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faA hamburger from Charlie Beinlich\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s in Glencoe.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Elena Zaremski\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faTango Sur \u201a\u00c4\u00ee the filet with spinach mashed potatoes.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Marcela Guzman\n\nRead more answers from our readers here.\n\n10:08 a.m. How we should honor our youngest COVID-19 victim\n\nErnesto Guzman, age 12, suffered from asthma and obstructive sleep apnea, two other underlying health problems with potentially serious consequences that have figured into many other COVID-19 deaths, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office.\n\nBut make no mistake, doctors say it was the coronavirus that caused the pneumonia that took Ernesto\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s life early Thursday morning at Advocate Christ Medical Center, Oak Lawn.\n\nBecause his death occurred after midnight, it is not yet counted among the 3,928 official COVID-19 deaths in Illinois, but it was listed among the single-day record high of 126 deaths reported Thursday from Cook County by the medical examiner.\n\nWill the death of a 12-year-old boy cause more people to take this disease seriously? Mark Brown says he doubts it. But he hopes that will change.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faTake this seriously, folks,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he wrote. \u201a\u00c4\u00faTake it very seriously, because the life you risk may not be your own.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nRead Mark Brown\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s full column here.\n\n8:49 a.m. Abbott rapid COVID-19 test may yield false negatives, FDA warns\n\nThe federal Food and Drug Administration issued a warning Thursday night that early data suggests Abbott Laboratories\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 rapid coronavirus test, touted by the Trump administration as a game changer, may return inaccurate and false negative results \u201a\u00c4\u00ee findings the Chicago-area firm vehemently denied.\n\nThe Abbott ID NOW test \u201a\u00c4\u00ee which can provide results in minutes \u201a\u00c4\u00ee is used by the White House to quickly test anyone who comes into proximity of President Donald Trump. Trump has lavished attention on the Abbott ID NOW test and featured it at a White House event three days after the FDA fast-tracked its approval by granting an emergency use authorization on March 27.\n\nIn just a few weeks time, Abbott has shipped 1.8 million of the ID NOW tests, which is used at several Chicago-area testing sites.\n\nThe FDA warning came a day after a New York University preliminary study raised questions about its accuracy. The study was not subject to peer review, a process that checks on the procedures used for a study as well as its findings.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n7:03 a.m. \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Grandstanding\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 by Grand Old Party? Or is Pritzker masking his decisions?\n\nSPRINGFIELD \u201a\u00c4\u00ee After weeks of nudges from Republican legislators, the General Assembly is planning to return to Springfield to get back to work.\n\nAnd as they prepare for the Legislature\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s long-sought session next week, Republicans said Thursday they are willing to comply with safety guidelines issued by the Democrats \u201a\u00c4\u00ec but they want an examination of their own.\n\nGOP lawmakers said they will wear face coverings, submit to COVID-19 tests and temperature checks and follow other safety measures when they return to Springfield, but they balked at signing a pledge to follow those recommendations as requested by House Speaker Mike Madigan.\n\nAnd Republicans want to put Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faRestore Illinois\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 plan under the microscope with a public hearing.\n\nGOP lawmakers have criticized Pritzker\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faRestore Illinois\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 plan as \u201a\u00c4\u00faarbitrary,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 saying the dates in which parts of the states can begin to reopen don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t make sense, and its metrics ignore geographical differences in COVID-19\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s impact.\n\nRead the full story by Neal Earley here.\n\n6:45 a.m. With the focus on the coronavirus, Lightfoot opts for bare-bones capital plan\n\nSingularly focused on the war against the coronavirus, Mayor Lori Lightfoot has opted for a $100 million, bare bones capital plan \u201a\u00c4\u00ee bankrolled by an existing line of credit \u201a\u00c4\u00ee to pay for new vehicles, sidewalks and the treasured aldermanic menu program.\n\nNormally, the city issues general obligation bonds backed by property taxes to cover a more sweeping capital program. But these are not normal times.\n\nThe Lightfoot administration is preoccupied with the city\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s response to the coronavirus and the budget crisis triggered by the stay-at-home shutdown of the Chicago economy.\n\nSo the decision was made to proceed only with those capital projects and purchases that absolutely needed to get done and to finance it with a line of credit that remained, even after Lightfoot saved $22 million by eliminating a $1.4 billion line of credit negotiated by former Mayor Rahm Emanuel.\n\nRead the full story by Fran Spielman here.\n\nNew cases\n\nAnalysis & Commentary\n\n7:47 p.m. Everything must be on the table as city, state fight back from financial devastation\n\nWashington to cities and states: You\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re on your own.\n\nFor months, the Trump administration has failed to take the lead in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, punting responsibility to the states. Now the president and his Republican Party are looking to do the same when it comes to helping states and cities survive the pandemic\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s financial devastation.\n\nA $3 trillion stimulus package expected to be approved by the Democratic-controlled House looks dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate, and President Donald Trump is making clear he would never sign such a bill.\n\nWhy? Because the package to rescue drowning cities, suburbs, states, small businesses and unemployed Americans would be fiscally imprudent, they claim.\n\nWe couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t disagree more. And, yes, this is the same Senate and president who rewrote the federal tax code in 2017 to give billions of dollars in tax cuts to the wealthiest one percent of Americans, ballooning the federal deficit.\n\nSo what does all this mean for Illinois and Chicago, as well as for towns and counties statewide?\n\nRead the full editorial from the CST Editorial Board here.\n\n6:35 p.m. Gov. Pritzker fumbles rollout of \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Restore Illinois\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\n\nFor many weeks after the beginning of this COVID-19 crisis, Gov. J.B. Pritzker proved adept at telegraphing his every move.\n\nPritzker waited until people practically begged him to shut down the schools on March 15. He talked about issuing a stay-at-home order for days, and then acted on March 21 only after California jumped first.\n\nIt was clear for days that he would extend his stay-at-home order another month starting April 1. He talked for well over a week about a mask-wearing requirement, always noting that he was being lobbied by Republican state Rep. Mark Batinick before finally announcing the order on April 23.\n\nPeople did not always agreed with him, but they always had a sense of where he was going. Pritzker did get out over his skis when his Illinois Workers\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 Compensation Commission dramatically altered the burden of proof on COVID-19 illnesses in favor of employees without so much as a heads-up to business groups. But most regular folks never noticed that and a court intervened and stopped the order anyway.\n\nOtherwise, the governor did a remarkably good job of making sure the public was always aware in advance of his leadership direction.\n\nAnd then on May 5 he announced his \u201a\u00c4\u00faRestore Illinois\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 roadmap to gradually reopen the state.\n\nRead the full column from Rich Miller here.\n\n6:53 a.m. Chicago\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s flag, civic pride and the fight against COVID-19\n\nIf Chicago were to add a fifth star to the city\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s flag, an awful lot of hipsters would have to get their tattoos reworked.\n\nMaybe it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s best we just leave the flag as it is, even if the city manages to prevail against COVID-19.\n\nLast Friday and again on Wednesday, Mayor Lori Lightfoot floated the idea of adding a fifth red star to Chicago\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s flag to mark the city\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s response to the coronavirus pandemic. She was trying to rally the city. If Chicago\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s effort to beat the virus is terrifically successful, she said Friday, it will \u201a\u00c4\u00fatruly warrant a fifth star on our flag.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBut let\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s be blunt. Chicago\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not about to be terrifically successful anytime soon. Nobody is. This is a global public health war that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s sure to be fought for years, and a lot of people are setting us up to lose.\n\nRead the full Sun-Times editorial here.\n\n6:10 a.m. Navy Pier is an arm of government, no matter what it claims \u201a\u00c4\u00ee so let\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s see every contract\n\nNow that the nonprofit that runs Navy Pier is getting a federal stimulus loan of nearly $2.5 million, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s really way past time that it opened its books to the public completely.\n\nNavy Pier Inc., which leases the 104-year-old pier from the public, is a government body that masquerades as a nonprofit organization. As such, it has been allowed to hide its workings from public scrutiny while benefiting from public support.\n\nNavy Pier Inc. pays just $1 a year to the state and city to lease the pier.\n\nAnd just this week, Sun-Times reporters Tim Novak and Robert Herguth revealed that the organization, whose president is paid more than $540,000 a year, has received a nearly $2.5 million coronavirus stimulus loan from the federal government\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Paycheck Protection Program.\n\nLike all nonprofits, Navy Pier Inc. must disclose much of its finances by filing 990 forms, but it does not have to comply with Freedom of Information Act requests or disclose the terms of contracts.\n\nRead the full editorial here."

Please enable JavaScript for the best experience.\n\nHundreds of thousands have died and millions of cases have been reported worldwide in the covid-19 pandemic, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The United States is now the outbreak\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4s epicenter, with more recorded deaths and reported infections than any other country.\n\nSeveral countries are confirming thousands of new cases of covid-19 each day, led by the United States, where testing was slow to begin.\n\nOn March 31, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the pandemic \u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00fathe most challenging crisis we have faced since the Second World War.\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f9\n\nReported deaths Reported cases Deaths Cases Adjusted Adj. for population Raw numbers Per 100K Total Deaths Cases\n\n[Tracking the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, state by state]\n\nThe disease, which can trigger severe respiratory symptoms, has been reported on every continent except Antarctica and in at least 180 countries. The World Health Organization declared covid-19 a pandemic on March 11.\n\nThe U.S. total of reported cases is by far the highest in the world. Covid-19 has been confirmed in every state and in most U.S. territories. As more tests are performed, many states are seeing rapid growth in the number of known cases.\n\nReported cases Reported deaths\n\n[A more detailed look at the virus's spread through U.S. counties and states]\n\nIn the early months, China, where the outbreak originated last year, reported more cases than any other country. Its tally of new infections peaked in mid-February and approached zero by mid-March, although questions surround the accuracy of its data.\n\nWhile the virus appears to have plateaued or declined in much of Europe, many countries in South America, South Asia and the Middle East have reported increases in the number of cases.\n\n[What you need to know about coronavirus]\n\nAs the disease waned in China, it began to surge in Italy and Spain. By May, more than 150,000 people had died throughout Europe.\n\nDeaths Cases Adjusted Adj. for population Raw numbers Per 100K Total Deaths Cases\n\nCoronaviruses range from some common cold viruses to those that cause much more serious diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Some strains spread more efficiently than others; the virus that causes covid-19 seems to spread easily from person to person, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n[Graphic: How epidemics like covid-19 end (and how to end them faster)]\n\nReported deaths Reported cases\n\nNumber of cases data collected by Johns Hopkins University. U.S. reported cases and deaths are from Johns Hopkins University and Post reporting.\n\n*On April 4, Johns Hopkins University began to include some 22,000 cases from French nursing homes that had previously been absent from their data, accounting for much of the spike in cases on that day, according to Le Monde.\n\nLauren Tierney, Joe Fox, Tim Meko, Chris Alcantara, John Muyskens, Shelly Tan, Adri\u221a\u00c9\u00ac\u00b0n Blanco, Armand Emamdjomeh, Youjin Shin, Monica Ulmanu, Harry Stevens, Kevin Schaul and Bonnie Berkowitz contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nHow to prepare for the coronavirus in the U.S.\n\nHow the coronavirus tanked the markets\n\nMillions of tweets peddled conspiracy theories about coronavirus in other countries, an unpublished U.S. report says\n\nWhite House preparing to ask Congress for more money to finance coronavirus response\n\nCoronavirus came from bats or possibly pangolins amid \u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f2acceleration\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4 of new zoonotic infections\n\nAn earlier version of this graphic included Hong Kong cases that were being monitored."

A day earlier, presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that in order to remove quarantine restrictions, one needs to know the dynamics of the spread of the virus on May 11 and take into account peculiarities of Russian regions.\n\nOn May 6, it was reported that Olga Lyubimova, Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Minister of Culture, became infected with the coronavirus. The minister is going through the mild course of the disease, so there is no need to hospitalize her yet. Olga Lyubimova has thus become a third member of the Russian government, who was infected with COVID-19.\n\nOn April 30, it was reported that the Prime Minister of Russia Mikhail Mishustin was infected with coronavirus. Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov has been appointed acting head of government. On May 1, Vladimir Yakushev, the Minister of Construction, Housing and Communal Services of Russia, was also hospitalized with coronavirus.\n\nRussians persistently violate self-isolation regime\n\nMeanwhile, Russia will have to experience a new surge in the incidence of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, Ivan Konovalov, assistant professor of infectious diseases in children at the Russian National Medical University named after Pirogov said.\n\nAccording to the professor, Russia will see a sharp growth of infections in one or two weeks because most Russians violate self-isolation regime during May holidays. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNo plateau is yet in sight as it requires no growth trend for several consecutive weeks,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the specialist said.\n\nIf citizens start taking to the streets thinking that everyone will catch COVID-19 sooner or later, the number of seriously ill patients will start snowballing. Such a trend is especially dangerous for regions where hospitals are already overwhelmed, while many doctors quit their jobs and leave being unable to cope with hard conditions of work."

                        "article_content": "The Egyptian superstar, who netted 29 goals for the Merseyside squad last season and was named the best Premier League player in 2017/2018, constantly appears in sports news with the world\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s best clubs wanting to sign the 27-year-old.\n\nLiverpool striker Mohamed Salah rejected an offer by Real Madrid in 2018, the Egyptian national team assistant coach has revealed. In an interview with OnTime Sports Hany Ramzy said Salah broke the news during training.\"I was talking to Salah and he told me that Real Madrid had sent him an offer. The offer was really good, but Salah discussed it with me and Mr Cuper [the former coach of Egypt's national football team ], and he decided to stay with Liverpool because he was comfortable there\", Ramzy told OnTime Sports.\n\nIt appears that Salah's decision to stay at Anfield paid off. The Reds, who lost to Real Madrid in the Champions League final that year, performed brilliantly the following year. Not only did they win the most prestigious club football tournament in the world last season, making an historic comeback against Barcelona in the semi-final, they finished second in the Premier League losing one point to champions Manchester City and Salah played the key role in the club's success. This year Liverpool has looked leven more stunning. The Reds are on top of the Premier League table with a 25 point lead and are on the way to winning their first domestic trophy after a 30-year title drought.\n\nThe English Premier League plans to resume on 12 June after a long break caused by the coronavirus pandemic. However, not all players are happy about it. Chelsea striker Willian is keen to return to the pitch, but only when it is safe to do so. Britain has the second highest death toll (34,466) from the infectious disease after the United States (90,113). The number of confirmed cases stands at 240,161, according to real-time statistics website Worldometer."

Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.\n\nBy far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not going to play that game,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not uniform across states and across countries.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBut even beyond the death count, there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the official said.\n\nSome Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t been able to focus on getting the response right.\n\nTrump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSo it is a war and I define victory when it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said on May 1. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt can never be a total victory because too many people have died.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nWhen American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.\n\nOthers are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAllowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 argued one Republican close to the president.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sen. Lindsey Graham\n\nBut, he added, \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf things don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t look like they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re bouncing back by September, I think that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to be a problem.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe fear that Trump can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.\n\nWhen asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the \u201a\u00c4\u00faeconomic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nA spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.\n\nOthers are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)"

Besides Melinda Gates\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 inverted cross, here\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 2 more examples of satanic symbolism related to the \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Gates of Hell\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 family and the upcoming \u201a\u00c4\u00f2mark of the beast\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 vaccine:\n\n1.

Microsoft Funds ID2020 And Files Patent For Device Attached To The Human Body For Buying And Selling Bitcoin \u201a\u00c4\u00ec Patent #666\n\nThey like to put their true agenda right in our faces, and dare us to figure it out. Take a quick trip to our Predictive Programming section, and you will see immediately what we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re talking about.\n\nAll this brings us to an interview the TODAY Show did with Melinda Gates back on November 8th, where we see Melinda wearing an upside-down, or inverted, cross around her neck.\n\nWho likes to wear inverted crosses? Satanists, pagans, witches, warlocks, New Agers, most people in Hollywood \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 you get the idea.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faChrist hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Galatians 3:13 (KJB)\n\nThe early First Century Christians never used the cross as a sign or symbol for anything, why? Because it was the instrument of the torturous death of Jesus of Nazareth.\n\nThe cross as iconic symbolism would not appear until biblical Christianity was hijacked by the Romans around 325 AD. From that point on you see crosses on everything as Rome infused paganism with Christianity.\n\nThe bible tells us that the cross is the sign of a curse, and cursed people hang on them. No one in their right minds who believed the bible would want the sign of a curse hanging around their own necks, much less wearing an upside-down cross like the pagans / satanists do.\n\nI will let you make up your own mind as to why Melinda Gates chose to wear an upside-down cross on national television.\n\nI know she went to Catholic school, and that she and Bill have raised their children as Catholics.\n\nBut when you look at the millions of dollars they give to Planned Parenthood, an organization that exists to slaughter children in the womb, exactly what kind of Catholic she is gets a little murky, to say the least.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church, what I like to call counterfeit Christianity, loves weird occult and pagan symbolism.\n\nOver the years we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve shown you the Vatican Audience Hall that is shaped exactly like a giant snake, and has the freakiest, most nastiest-looking statue right behind here the pope sits. [It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s also worth mentioning that the pope\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s throne has a massive inverted cross on it.]\n\nOccult symbolism pervades the Vatican to a very high degree. Melinda Gates is a Catholic, you do the math.\n\nMelinda Gates on pandemic: \u201a\u00c4\u00f2We haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t had leadership at the national level \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s chaos\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\n\nFROM TODAY: As part of our coronavirus series The Search for Solutions, TODAY\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Savannah Guthrie spoke exclusively to Melinda Gates, who is working to address the pandemic through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nShe says there are \u201a\u00c4\u00faa few good candidates\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 for a vaccine and that the U.S. needs \u201a\u00c4\u00fato start looking at a paid medical leave policy\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to help workers on the front lines.\n\nShe also criticizes the Trump administration for its response to the crisis: \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t had leadership at the national level \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s chaos.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 (Read more)\n\nI will include the top comments just incase they decide to close the comments section:\n\nSource: Nowtheendbegins.com"

                        "article_content": "is a UK journalist, ex-Fleet Street editor, financial industry consultant and political communications special advisor in the UK and EU.\n\nis a UK journalist, ex-Fleet Street editor, financial industry consultant and political communications special advisor in the UK and EU.\n\nFeminists on the frontline of gender politics have seized on a poll they helped publish to push their agenda to the fore in a crisis that has wrecked everyone\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s economies and lives. Disproportionate male deaths got a side note.\n\nA new poll by IPSOS Mori declares that UK women are bearing the emotional brunt of the coronavirus pandemic. Fair point, but is it sexist to mention that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s men who actually die more?\n\nIn fact, men are almost twice as likely as women to die from the coronavirus, but women, as the study has found, are about 15 to 20 percent more worried about various other aspects of the pandemic.\n\nI get it. The poll was published in conjunction with the Fawcett Society, named for the iconic suffragette Millicent Fawcett, so with a touch of cynicism you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll see the goal here.\n\nAlso on rt.com Covid-19 is a disaster for everyone\u201a\u00c4\u00b6 except straight white men?\n\nEven though the study mentions up front the fact men are in more danger from disease itself, that mention is nowhere to be found in the headlines on the Fawcett Society (why would it be?), or IPSOS, or the Guardian, which declares: \u201a\u00c4\u00f2UK women bear emotional brunt of Covid-19 turmoil \u201a\u00c4\u00ec poll\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 and mentions problems of risk and unemployment they face. Their stories do mention that men are dying disproportionately but hey, women are affected in other ways that aren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t death.\n\nAnd isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t that more important? My guess is I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m seen as a man just propagating a culture of male domination, though biased feminist polling is a-okay.\n\nPolls are commissioned to prove a point that needs apparently objective validation. Very rarely does a political outfit pay a polling company without having a fair idea of what the results will be. What they seek is the credibility earned by using an independent polling business that gives the results kudos.\n\nSo we have 61 percent of women struggling day to day to stay positive while 47 percent of men admit to feeling the same.\n\nIn gender politics the old adage that a woman\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s work is never done holds true, particularly when that woman is fighting on the feminist frontline and there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s suddenly an unexpected opportunity to strike a blow against the patriarchal hegemony.\n\nManning up\n\nRead more\n\nWhat is conveniently overlooked is that data collection on an issue such as this is skewed by its very nature.\n\nYou\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not asking what sort of soap powder an interviewee prefers here, you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re asking men and women how they feel.\n\nAnd there lies the problem. While women are far more upfront about peaks and troughs in their emotions, a man asked to explain his feelings will do nothing of the sort. Hardwired to put on a front, most blokes will shrug and mumble, \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not too worried\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 even when pushed whether he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s concerned at the death of thousands of his countrymen at the hands of an invisible virus.\n\nIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not that it isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t something to bother about or that men are mostly unfeeling, uncaring boneheaded neanderthals, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s just that the average Joe would rather not discuss his emotions with you and a relatively neutral answer is far more likely to end a line of questioning sooner than if he opened up and blubbed out his darkest nightmares.\n\nSo while six out of 10 women admit they are struggling and less than half of men questioned admitted to feeling likewise, it has to be concluded, \u201a\u00c4\u00faWell they would say that!\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s people who suffer, not men or women\n\nAnd it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not just the elastic treatment of poll results that irritate here, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the gender politics at play when it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s really not appropriate.\n\nIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00f2people\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 who are suffering, whose loved ones are dead, jobs lost, schools shut and dreams in tatters.\n\nIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not a man and woman thing, its humanity as a whole and it is wrong and insensitive to prioritise one group over another, whether they be different sexes, ages, races or religions. But Sam Smethers, the Fawcett Society CEO, has found a man-shaped windmill to tilt at pushing a feminist agenda that somehow men are using the pandemic to assert masculine dominance.\n\nShe recently drummed up support from the various members of The Sisterhood to sign a joint statement explaining how bad things are for women in the UK since the pandemic struck.\n\nAlso on rt.com The gender sleep gap? Wake me up when the nightmare of modern feminism is over\n\nThe statement spoke of women being \u201a\u00c4\u00falargely invisible from the debate and excluded from decision-making,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and many were \u201a\u00c4\u00fatrapped in their homes, self-isolating with an abusive partner\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 as if this was the norm. I found that claim insulting.\n\nIt goes on about \u201a\u00c4\u00faspecific challenges women are facing,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 having \u201a\u00c4\u00favoices heard\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00faneeds met.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Certainly, interesting ideas to discuss, and there may even be some valid demands in there.\n\nThere is no mention anywhere among these concerns about who the majority of victims of the Covid-19 crisis might be.\n\nIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s strange, because they are the grandfathers, fathers, husbands and sons of the gender-obsessed feminist brigade who insist on propagating nonsense like this week\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s poll results.\n\nLike this story?

On Friday afternoon, SpaceX successfully fired the engines on the Falcon 9 rocket for a short test to ensure they were operating correctly. On Saturday, astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley will suit up and go through the prelaunch procedures one last time. A final launch readiness review will be held on Monday.\n\nThe launch still could be delayed by weather or any number of last-minute mechanical glitches.\n\n\u00ac\u00a9 Bill Ingalls/AFP/Getty Images Friday's brief static fire test.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to stay vigilant over the next few days,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Kathy Lueders, the director of NASA\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s commercial crew program.\n\nShe added that \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe are trying to identify any risks that are out there, and continue to look at risk, and buy them down. But we also can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t fool ourselves, human spaceflight is really, really tough.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThere'll be lots more data, lots more reviews in the next few days,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Benji Reed, SpaceX\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s director of crew and mission management. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThere will be constant vigilance and watching of the data and observations as we go through the mission.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nOfficials from NASA and SpaceX said part of the review focused on the safety of the parachutes that would deploy and slow the Dragon spacecraft as it drops through the Earth\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s atmosphere, bringing the astronauts home. SpaceX had been working to qualify a new design of the parachute systems that NASA said it is now comfortable with.\n\nBehnken and Hurley have been in quarantine for more than a week, a normal procedure for astronauts going to space. But NASA and SpaceX have said they have been taking additional precautions because of the coronavirus pandemic. At a news briefing Friday, Hurley said he and Behnken have been tested for the coronavirus twice and \u201a\u00c4\u00farumor has it we might be tested again before we go.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe pair would join Chris Cassidy, the lone NASA astronaut on board the station, and two Russian counterparts.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faHe likes solitude,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Hurley said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut it was very obvious that he is ready for some human interaction with us.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9"

The post would place him in charge of overseeing a roughly $500 billion Treasury fund for industry created as part of the economic rescue law approved in late March.\n\nGet the latest news about the coronavirus and its ripple effects in Chicago and Illinois in our live blog.\n\nIn prepared testimony, Miller pledged to be vigilant in protecting the integrity and independence of his office and vowed \u201a\u00c4\u00fato seek the truth in all matters that come before me and to use my authority and resources to uncover fraud, waste and abuse.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\n\nMiller has worked at the Justice Department and was inspector general for nearly a decade at the General Services Administration, which oversees thousands of federal contracts. While he is respected in the oversight community, Miller\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s role in the White House counsel\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office \u201a\u00c4\u00ee which led Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s defense during impeachment \u201a\u00c4\u00ee is troubling, Democrats and watchdog groups said.\n\nOhio Sen. Sherrod Brown, top Democrat on the banking panel, said he questions whether Miller will be able to hold the Trump administration accountable for how it administers the business program and \u201a\u00c4\u00faguarantee that corporations getting taxpayer money put their workers first.\u201a\u00c4\u2265\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faMr. Miller will be called upon to answer how he will ensure he is independent and will hold the administration accountable,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 Brown said in a statement.\n\nNoah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said Miller\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nomination is part of a pattern of \u201a\u00c4\u00faroadblocks thrown up\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 by Trump to block oversight of his administration.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has fired an inspector general tied to his impeachment and sidelined another who was set to lead a group of inspectors general overseeing the rescue package. On Friday night, Trump moved to replace yet another inspector general, an acting official who criticized the coronavirus response by federal health officials.\n\nTrump also said in signing the rescue law that he will resist oversight provisions.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faAll of this taken together means real oversight will be met with retribution, which makes it all the more important,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 Bookbinder said."

                        "article_content": "Photo illustration by Slate. Rendering by urfinguss/iStock/Getty Images Plus.\n\nThis article is part of Reopenings, a series about how businesses are operating during the pandemic.\n\nYou can gamble again in America\u201a\u00c4\u00eeat least in the few parts of the country where casinos are cautiously reopening. Casinos in Oklahoma and Montana already have the go-ahead from their state governments to operate, though many are opting to stay closed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Some casinos on tribal lands in Michigan and Idaho have also opened their doors, since they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re only regulated by the federal government and do not have to abide by state-mandated lockdowns.\n\nBut casinos in the After Times won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be the same bustling, hand-contact-heavy places they were. They\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll have fewer games, more protective barriers, and a lot less razzle-dazzle.\n\nTake the Tonkawa Hotel & Casino, operated by the Tonkawa tribe and one of the few casinos in Oklahoma that chose to go back into business when the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s lockdown on nonessential businesses ended on May 1. (Many tribes have opted to voluntarily follow state lockdowns.) Now the casino is spacing out slot machines, installing hand sanitizer dispensers throughout the property, requiring employees to wear masks and gloves, increasing the frequency of cleanings for cage counters and card tables, and using thermal cameras to check whether people entering are running a temperature above 100 degrees, according to its director of marketing, Billy Burt.\n\nExpect similar protocols as casinos around the country reopen their floors. Executives at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket, Connecticut, have been following the initial openings in developing their own practices for when they eventually begin operations again, whenever that is. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSince we closed on March 17, we have been putting together a reopening plan,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 interim CEO Jason Guyot said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn our 28-year history, Foxwood had never closed its doors, so it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s been a pretty surreal process we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been going through.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nWhen Foxwoods reopens, it won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t offer poker, sports betting, keno, and bingo\u201a\u00c4\u00eepartly due to crowding concerns, and partly because the casino won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be bringing back enough staff at first to man all those games. For games like black jack, players won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be allowed to touch the cards and decks will be switched out more often, particularly when a new dealer takes over a shift. Foxwoods is strongly considering putting up plastic partitions between slot machines as well as at card tables to separate dealers from gamblers and gamblers from one another. A Las Vegas company called Screaming Images is currently developing recyclable clear acrylic dividers to keep people semi-isolated, which are being tested at the El Cortez casino in the city\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s downtown:\n\nI shot photos of these partitions this morning for @mickakers story about a company building them. https://t.co/qzKWBHm7hz via @reviewjournal \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Kevin M. Cannon (@kmcannonphoto) April 28, 2020\n\nMany matters are still up in the air. For instance, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unclear when performers can put on shows again, given the crowds they attract. However, Guyot is generally not too concerned about crowding at the property overall, because it spans more than 9 million square feet. Foxwoods managers are still trying to figure out how to clean betting chips. According to Guyot, many cleaning chemicals can cause them to discolor or stick together. And though employees will be sanitizing the chips multiple times throughout the day, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s still difficult to keep them clean once people start passing them around.\n\nFoxwoods and many other casinos have self-exclusion lists for people with gambling problems who voluntarily ask the establishments to bar them from entry. Given that Foxwoods will require all visitors to wear masks, it may be difficult to identify these people. For now, the plan is to ask people to temporarily remove their masks during the screening process just long enough for a camera to get a good glimpse of their faces.\n\nLike Foxwoods, most major casino chains have yet to set definitive reopening dates, though they have been gradually releasing details about the modifications they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll be making to their facilities to limit the virus\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s spread, partly based on stipulations from local regulators. For instance, the Nevada Gaming Control Board recently released guidelines for how casinos should adjust their business practices. Gambling establishments in Las Vegas and elsewhere in the state will need to devise plans to limit the number of people at card tables, sanitize items more regularly, and ensure that workers and guests are wearing masks. Wynn Resorts has said that it will be removing chairs from table games and has publicly released sanitation procedures for each individual game. The Venetian is using UV lights and electrostatic sprayers to clean its facilities. One Las Vegas casino is even handing out plastic sticks for people to press elevator buttons with, according to the Associated Press. Wynn and some other casinos are hoping to reopen at the end of May. Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman has repeatedly called for the city to reopen and serve as a testing ground for the rest of the country.\n\nThe elderly population, which is a huge demographic for casinos, might not want to risk infection.\n\nThese new regulations are sure to change casinos\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 atmosphere and even the dynamics and strategy of some games. For example, craps tables in Nevada will only be allowed to have six players at a time, which probably means that casino floors will be a lot quieter. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSometimes in a casino you hear all this screaming and yelling because at the craps table you get an excited crowd and somebody gets on a hot roll,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Steve Bourie, author of the American Casino Guide. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHard to do that with six people. Normally you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d have 20, 25 people around a hot table.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Bourie also mentioned that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll be tougher for card sharks, who usually make money off less-skilled players, to find targets since there will only be four people per poker table in Nevada rather than the usual 10. And he predicts that some casinos may have to raise limits on black jack games because the house won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be able to make as much money with only three players allowed at each table.\n\nGuyot has put a lot of thought into how these new measures will change the casino-going experience. He worries that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll be tough for employees to convey warmth and congeniality given that they have to wear masks and distance themselves from customers. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen you see someone with a mask on, even when you have one on, you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not as comfortable engaging,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOne of the biggest things from a team-member perspective is that there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to be less of that service interaction with a smile.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Foxwoods is working on altering its training program given that employees\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 facial expressions won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be as visible to customers.\n\nWhen more casinos do get back up and running, Bourie isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t quite sure just how many people will actually show up. He notes that the elderly population, which is a huge demographic for casinos, might not want to risk infection. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m sure a lot of people are going to be scared. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a form of entertainment and people develop habits of going to casinos and having fun,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut their habits have been broken, and they haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t gone in six weeks or so. So some people may find that they might not want to go so much anymore. They\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re scared.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Bourie noted that online gambling has seen a surge in recent weeks, so people may opt to stick with that for the time being."

                        "article_content": "If 2020 does meet that forecast, it would mark a new record of five consecutive above-normal Atlantic hurricane seasons, surpassing a previous record of four seasons during 1998 to 2001, Gerry Bell, the lead forecaster with the Climate Prediction Center, told reporters.\n\nNOAA's Climate Prediction Center predicted a 60 percent chance of an above-normal 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, with a 30 percent chance of a near-normal season. The agency predicted just a 10 percent chance of a below-normal season.\n\n\"NOAA's analysis of current and seasonal atmospheric conditions reveals a recipe for an active Atlantic hurricane season this year,\" said acting NOAA Administrator Neil Jacobs in a statement.\n\nThe outlook for the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season also comes as researchers at NOAA and the University of Wisconsin-Madison identified a link between the growing intensity of tropical storms and human-driven climate change, mapping out the growing strength of hurricanes and typhoons over the past four decades.\n\nNOAA said Thursday a combination of factors contributed to predictions for above-normal storm activity, including warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, as well as El Ni\u221a\u00b1o conditions that can suppress hurricane activity and are expected to remain neutral or to trend toward La Ni\u221a\u00b1a.\n\nShould more of this year's storms make landfall, it could pose problems for state and local emergency responders and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which have been dealing with the coronavirus pandemic and would see their efforts complicated by social distancing and other measures enacted to slow the spread of Covid-19.\n\nFEMA warned earlier this week that this year's hurricane season poses \"added complexities\" for first responders and state and local officials amid the pandemic. It's advised communities to secure \"non-congregate\" shelters for evacuees, such as hotels and dormitories, and ensure search-and-rescue teams and volunteers have proper protective equipment to prevent the spread of Covid-19.\n\nCarlos Castillo, acting deputy administrator for resilience at FEMA, told reporters that the agency has responded to more than one large disaster at the same time before, such as in 2018, when the agency responded to two major hurricanes on the East Coast and wildfires in California.\n\n\"I want to reassure the nation that FEMA continues to take deliberate and proactive steps, working closely with our state, local, tribal, territorial, federal, nonprofit and private sector partners to safeguard our ability to respond and recover from future disasters that may arise during this pandemic,\" Castillo said.\n\nIn a hurricane preparation guidance released Wednesday, FEMA said it will \u201a\u00c4\u00fagenerally minimize\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 deployments to disaster-hit areas, an acknowledgment of both strained capacity and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to limit unnecessary person-to-person contact to curb the coronavirus. Instead, FEMA will rely more on virtual coordination.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIf you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re in a situation where you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve got a declaration or where a storm has hit, yeah, we are looking at ways to scale back,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 FEMA spokesperson Lea Crager told POLITICO.\n\nSocial distancing measures also have complicated evacuation plans for areas that lie in a storm's path. FEMA has discouraged use of gymnasiums, arenas and convention centers that traditionally double as shelters. FEMA instead emphasized \u201a\u00c4\u00fanon-congregate\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 shelters such as hotels and dormitories, and suggested people consider staying home even under conditions like power outages.\n\nAs a result, overall shelter capacity will likely be diminished this year, Crager said, meaning communities will have to \u201a\u00c4\u00fathink outside the box\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ee though she acknowledged people might be afraid to go to shelters anyway given potential for viral infection. FEMA has tried to smooth the process for emergency planners by signaling to them early that it will reimburse a portion \u201a\u00c4\u00ee typically at least 75 percent \u201a\u00c4\u00ee of expenses for securing those types of non-congregate shelters.\n\nThe long-standing emergency plans that communities dust off every hurricane season tend to rely on massive shelters, so changing their procedures will present challenges, said Daniel Kaniewski, the former FEMA deputy administrator who left the agency in February.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faYou want to get this nailed down with as much advance notice as possible so states can plan based on that policy,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Kaniewski, who is now managing director at insurance firm Marsh & McLennan. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHonestly, when these policies change, it takes a lot of coordination and planning and even exercising of that new policy. You can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t just flip a switch.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBut some towns don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have enough hotels or motels to meet local needs, said Colin Wellenkamp, executive director of the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative, which works with local governments along the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s largest river.\n\nEven coping with the simplest preparations that FEMA has outlined is a struggle, he said, and many local governments will struggle to pay for rooms even if they have them, or to cover the costs for personal protective equipment and acquire tests needed to handle potential evacuees.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat cities are telling me is they don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have enough money right now to handle a pandemic and a major disaster at the same time,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Wellenkamp said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve spent so much money on the pandemic and our revenues have taken such a hit because of the closures and unemployment.\"\n\nEven if the federal government promises to reimburse localities, that \"doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t help you if you don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have the cash to make the purchases in the first place,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Wellenkamp added.\n\nThe twin pandemic and hurricane efforts are also stretching nonprofit organizations that help locate shelter sites, staff evacuation centers and bring in necessary supplies and food, said Gregory Forrester, CEO of National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster, a coalition of nonprofit groups.\n\nMany volunteers are elderly and will be vulnerable to Covid-19, he said, which, combined with the imperative to keep the virus from spreading to new areas, means trying to find additional local personnel without underlying medical conditions. Many nonprofits also haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t been able to fundraise for the hurricane season while they respond to the coronavirus.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe cost factors are higher but you plan for a certain degree and hope for the best,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Forrester said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s like any other hurricane season \u201a\u00c4\u00ee nobody could have ever predicted a Harvey and Maria within six weeks of each other\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in 2017."

Funded by the communist regime, these centers are marketed as Chinese language and culture centers. However, U.S. intelligence officials have warned that these centers are little more than \u201a\u00c4\u00fapropaganda\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 arms of the communist country.\n\nThe radical left will stop at nothing to intimidate conservative students on college campuses.

They\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4re exploiting the very open research and development environment that we have, which we all revere. But they\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4re taking advantage of it.\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f9\n\nCIA reports obtained by\u221a\u00c7 The Washington Free Beacon\u221a\u00c7 further revealed, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe [Chinese Communist Party] provides \u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f2strings-attached\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 funding to academic institutions and think tanks to deter research that casts it in a negative light. It has used this tactic to reward pro-China viewpoints and coerce Western academic publications and conferences to self-censor. The CCP often denies visas to academics who criticize the regime, encouraging many China scholars to preemptively self-censor so they can maintain access to the country on which their research depends.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nWhile legislation signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2018 resulted in about a dozen U.S. colleges shuttering Confucius Institutes on campus, those closures were largely the result of their loss of funding, rather than concerns for the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s national security.\n\nAnd now, nearly two years after that legislation became law, more than 75 Confucius Institutes are still in operation in the U.S., most of them on college campuses. From Maine to Florida to Kansas to California, these centers claim to educate American students about Chinese language and culture, and administrators who run the campuses on which they operate appear to believe the same country that claims to have fewer coronavirus deaths than the U.S, despite its population being more than three times the size of the U.S. population.\n\nBased on data from the\u221a\u00c7 National Association of Scholars,\u221a\u00c7 along with records maintained by\u221a\u00c7 Campus Reform, the interactive map below shows the locations where Confucius Institutes still operate.

                        "article_content": "As the coronavirus pandemic continues to worsen in the US, NASA is still moving forward with many of its upcoming missions, including some launches that will send humans to the International Space Station in the near future. As of now, NASA does not foresee any changes being made to these missions, and there are already procedures in place to guarantee astronauts do not bring any illnesses with them into space.\n\nNASA has its own internal \u201a\u00c4\u00faresponse framework\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 for how it plans to deal with the pandemic. It lists four different stages for the agency, which each detail the amount of people who will work from home, the level of access to NASA facilities, and how much travel will be allowed. Right now, two NASA centers \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Ames Research Center and Marshall Space Flight Center \u201a\u00c4\u00ee are on Stage 3, which makes telework mandatory and only allows \u201a\u00c4\u00famission-essential\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 personnel on site at facilities. NASA bumped these two centers to Stage 3 after employees tested positive for COVID-19 at each place.\n\nNASA has its own internal \u201a\u00c4\u00faresponse framework\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 for how to deal with the pandemic\n\nNASA\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Johnson Space Center, which oversees the agency\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s human spaceflight launches and operates the International Space Station, is only at Stage 2. At that level, teleworking is strongly encouraged, though not mandatory, while various facilities are closed down. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe health and safety of NASA\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s workforce is the agency\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s top priority. As the coronavirus (COVID-19) concern continues to escalate, NASA is taking steps to ensure its workforce is protected and informed,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 a NASA spokesperson at JSC said in a statement.\n\nBut as more workers at JSC stay home, they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re still looking ahead to the next launch of people to the ISS, which is slated for April 9th out of Kazakhstan. A Russian Soyuz rocket will launch three crew members, including NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy, to the station, where they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll join three people already in orbit.\n\nThat launch is still on, and NASA says the agency hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t made any changes to operations and schedule surrounding the mission. As of yesterday, Kazakhstan effectively closed its borders after reporting its first coronavirus cases in the country. No one can enter the country except for diplomats, returning citizens, and those invited by the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s government, according to Reuters. NASA is still assessing if changes are needed regarding how personnel will travel to Kazakhstan.\n\nOf course, the concern is that the astronauts flying to the station could carry the coronavirus with them, if they don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know that they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re infected with the virus. But NASA already has a long-held strategy in place for preventing astronauts from carrying any nasty bugs with them to space. All astronauts going to orbit must go through a two-week period of quarantine called \u201a\u00c4\u00fahealth stabilization,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to NASA. That way, the agency can make sure the crew is not incubating any illnesses before launch. However, NASA said it \u201a\u00c4\u00fawill continue to evaluate and augment this plan, in coordination with its international and commercial partners\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 if needed.\n\nIn the meantime, Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s state space corporation, Roscosmos, has decided to shut down all media activity surrounding the Soyuz launch, barring journalists from covering the mission in person. Russia will still live stream the launch, and NASA typically airs all of its crewed launches on its own online TV channel.\n\nAll astronauts going to orbit must go through a two-week period of quarantine\n\nOnce this launch is over, the next big milestone for JSC is the return of crew from the ISS. NASA astronauts Andrew Morgan, Jessica Meir, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka are slated to return to Earth in a Soyuz capsule in mid-April, landing in the Kazakhstan desert. Such landings typically require large groups of recovery personnel to extract the astronauts from the landed capsule. NASA did not provide any details if those operations would change in light of the pandemic.\n\nHowever, NASA has more than one upcoming crewed mission on its calendar. Soon, NASA\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s commercial partner SpaceX will be ready to send its first crew of NASA astronauts to the International Space Station. The launch is a critical one for NASA\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Commercial Crew Program, an initiative to develop privately funded vehicles to transport people to and from the ISS. SpaceX has been developing its Crew Dragon capsule for the program, and the first vehicle that will fly a crew of two to the station is already in Florida ahead of its inaugural flight.\n\nSpaceX is currently targeting May for that flight, according to the company\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s president Gwynne Shotwell. NASA also says that SpaceX\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s passengers for the mission, astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, are continuing to train for the mission as originally planned. As for operations at SpaceX, it seems like things are still moving ahead as usual. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk sent an email last week to the company\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s employees underplaying the coronavirus threat, arguing people were more likely to die in a car crash than from the virus.\n\nOf course, the situations at NASA and SpaceX are subject to change quickly. The coronavirus pandemic is ever-evolving, with cities, states, and countries making swift changes every few hours to combat the spread of the disease. And already, launches are being affected. Europe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s primary spaceport in French Guiana, South America is suspending all launches from the site for the foreseeable future, in order to protect the health of employees and people in the area.\n\nIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s possible that upcoming launches from the US could be postponed as well. It just depends on how companies plan to react and if governments take even more decisive action."

                        "article_content": "Fewer humans carelessly destroying their natural habitat has been a blessing for sea turtles in Florida.\n\nWith many beaches closed in Florida during the coronavirus pandemic, researchers see less plastic and less waste. There are fewer people and vehicles on the beach projecting artificial light; thus there is less disorientation for emerging hatchlings, according to David Godfrey, Executive Director for the Sea Turtle Conservancy.\n\nBecause of these factors, sea turtles can build nests without any disruptions.\n\nGodfrey said that nesting season for leatherback turtles, the largest of all sea turtles, is underway right now, mostly in the central-east and southeast coast of Florida. They nest in fewer numbers than the loggerheads, who arrive in May. Later in the summer months is when green turtles will come.\n\nIt takes approximately 60 days for sea turtle eggs to incubate and for hatchlings to emerge, Godfrey said. Many disturbing things can happen to their nests when humans take over their beaches. They trample and dig up the turtle\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nests and harm them with artificial light.\n\nRELATED STORY:\n\nRELATED STORY:\n\nWith an inactive beach, the turtles can carry on the way nature intended. Godfrey said:\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI think there is a strong likelihood that we will see decreased human-caused impacts on sea turtle nesting this year, which is a rare silver lining to this global pandemic. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s premature to try and use numbers to demonstrate what we all think and hope is happening. The numbers just aren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t there yet. I hear that the season is going pretty well so far, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s off to a good start.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nLess foot traffic improves the reptiles situation right now, but what will happen when the beaches reopen, and the sea turtles\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 eggs begin to hatch? Leatherback sea turtles will see hatchlings toward the end of April. Godfrey said researchers are working in uncharted territory, and only time will tell.\n\nRELATED STORY:\n\nDr. Justin Perrault, Director of Research at the Loggerhead Marinelife Center, said his team does worry that when the beaches reopen, there may be an influx of people flocking to the beach because they were stuck indoors for an extended period. He added:\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt just depends on the behavior of people after the closures end. And if there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s an excessive amount on the beaches, then more people means more interaction with turtles, which can be negative if they don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t follow the rules.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe city of Jacksonville announced beaches and parks in Duval County would open Friday with certain restrictions starting at 5 pm, according to the city\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Twitter page.\n\nPerrault said when people do return, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll be essential for them to to keep lights off whenever possible, maintain distance from marine animals, and leave the beach the way they found it. He added:\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faRemember that we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not the only species out there.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nSOURCE:\n\nShares"

                        "article_content": "(Natural News) Over 4,300 recovering COVID-19 patients were shipped off to New York\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4s nursing homes and long-term care facilities as a result of a controversial state directive, according to The Associated Press.\n\nIn a count published on its site Friday, the news organization tallied the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from hospitals and transferred to nursing homes under Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4s March 25 directive after the New York State Health Department declined to release the figures gleaned from its internal survey, conducted two weeks ago.\n\nThe health department is still verifying \u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00faincomplete\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f9 data.\n\nAccording to critics, the directive, which had been intended to help free up hospital beds for the sickest patients as cases surged, instead only helped speed up the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus in the mentioned establishments, in addition to placing an additional burden on already overwhelmed facilities.\n\n\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00faA number of nursing homes have felt constrained by the order and admitted hospital discharged patients without knowing what their COVID status was,\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f9 said Chris Laxton, executive director of the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.\n\nAccording to numbers posted by New York\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4s Department of Health, the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nursing home COVID-19 death toll stood well over 5,000 as of this writing, making it a significant chunk of the state\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4s total running death toll from the virus.\n\nThe directive, which also noted that the state\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4s nursing homes and related facilities cannot refuse patients, was reversed on May 10.\n\nFollowing intense criticism, Cuomo, in his subsequent media briefings, said he was merely following recommendations set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nNo matter how much Cuomo spins the said directive however, Stuart Almer, a nursing home operator, said it cannot be denied that the state order still put staff and residents at great risk.\n\n\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00faWe can\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4t draw a straight line from bringing in someone positive to someone catching the disease, but we\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4re talking about elderly, fragile and vulnerable residents,\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f9 Almer stated in an interview with AP. (Related: New York nursing homes now a \u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00faslaughterhouse\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f9 for elderly coronavirus patients.)\n\nAccording to Almer, his staff at Gurwin Jewish, a 460-bed nursing home on Long Island, had to scramble in order to accommodate what he called a \u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00faflood\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f9 of 58 recovering COVID-19 patients from local hospitals.\n\nAlmer stressed that while they did what they could to ensure the safety of their residents, such as by erecting more walls and by implementing other safety measures, residents at Gurwin nonetheless started falling sick, 47 of which died of confirmed or suspected COVID-19.\n\nThe families of those who died are furious.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt was the single dumbest decision anyone could make if they wanted to kill people,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Daniel Arbeeny told the AP in an interview.\n\nAccording to Arbeeny, his 88-year-old father succumbed to the virus after being pulled out of a Brooklyn nursing home that saw more than 50 deaths.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThis isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t rocket science. We knew the most vulnerable were in nursing homes and rehab centers,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Arbeeny said, citing studies that pointed to the elderly and immunocompromised as being the most likely to succumb to the virus.\n\nFormer New York lieutenant governor and Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths founder Betsy McCaughey did not mince words when speaking about the current situation in the state\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4s nursing homes.\n\n\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00faThey\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4re death pits,\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f9 McCaughey told The New York Times.\n\n\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00faThese nursing homes are already overwhelmed. They\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4re crowded and they\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4re understaffed. One COVID-positive patient in a nursing home produces carnage,\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f9 she added.\n\nAs of press time, the state of New York has recorded a running total of 358,000 infections and 23,195 deaths from the coronavirus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nSources include:\n\nTheEpochTimes.com\n\nAPNews.com 1\n\nAPNews.com 2\n\nNPR.org\n\nNYTimes.com"

The announcement was made on Wednesday morning by the Broadway League, an organization of theater owners and producers.\n\nBroadway brought in $1.8 billion in ticket sales and close to 15 million audience members last season. It's New York's top tourist attraction, bringing in more people than all of the tri-state area's professional sports teams combined. And many ancillary businesses have been affected, too \u201a\u00c4\u00ec hotels, taxi cabs, restaurants.\n\nWhen performances were suspended, 16 shows were scheduled to open before the Tony Awards deadline in late April \u201a\u00c4\u00ec two of them, a revival of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and Hangmen subsequently announced they were closing. The musical Beetlejuice will not reopen in June, may move to another theater later. Three shows at non-profit venues will postpone their productions to next season.\n\nThe pandemic's toll has rocked the community with personal losses, among them Tony Award-winning playwright Terrence McNally, character actor Mark Blum, and composer Adam Schlesinger."

                        "article_content": "Maurie Backman\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis has done extensive damage to the U.S. economy already, and the longer it drags on, the tougher our recovery is apt to be. But as difficult as things have been for individuals, the companies that employ them have been thrust into a very tricky set of circumstances, too.\n\nThe good news? Most workers are pleased with the way their employers have handled things in light of COVID-19, according to a recent survey by Workfest powered by Zenefits, an HR software company. Specifically, 67% of employees believe their employers genuinely care about their well-being and have taken steps to make that clear during the pandemic. And 74% think their employers took the right precautions to ensure employee safety during the crisis.\n\nGo to the mall?:Simon Property Group reopening more malls as more states reopen from coronavirus shutdown\n\nWalmart & Sam's Club:Retailers giving hourly employees coronavirus cash bonuses worth $390M in June\n\nA big part of protecting employees boils down to clear communication, and in this regard, 68% of employees agree that their employers have stepped up. But despite all of this positive news, workers remain concerned about their jobs.\n\nSpecifically, 51% of employees surveyed are anxious about their employment status given the state of the economy. And about half of workers think that the companies they work for won't last longer than three months without some type of financial assistance, or without the economy being able to open back up.\n\nIf you're worried about losing your job in the course of the ongoing crisis, you're clearly not alone. Here are four steps to take if that's a major concern.\n\n1. Talk to your employer\n\nYour employer may have more financial reserves than you'd expect. Before you spend sleepless nights worrying about a potential layoff, have an honest conversation with your boss. Express that you're concerned about losing your job and ask for a realistic view of where things stand in that regard. Your boss may tell you that your department is last on the chopping block, which could help you breathe easier. Or you may learn that your worries are legitimate, in which case having that knowledge can help you prepare for a layoff accordingly.\n\n2. Assess your savings\n\nPart of the reason so many Americans are struggling financially right now is that they don't have cash reserves in the bank. But if you have a healthy level of emergency savings, you may be in a stronger position to ride out a layoff should that come to be. Look at your savings balance and compare it to what your expenses entail. You may get some peace of mind if you see that you can easily cover three or four months' worth of bills without having to resort to a backup plan.\n\n3. Read up on unemployment benefits\n\nGenerally speaking, you're entitled to unemployment benefits if you lose your job through no fault of your own. These days, unemployment benefits are more generous than they've been in the past. As part of the COVID-19 relief package that was passed in March, you're now entitled to an extra $600 a week in addition to your regular unemployment benefit. This holds true even if that $600 boost results in a raise. Unemployment has also been extended by 13 weeks, which means you may be entitled to up to 39 weeks of benefits.\n\n4. Figure out what you'll do about health insurance\n\nYou may have a decent chunk of cash in emergency savings, and you may be entitled to a respectable unemployment benefit should your job be taken away. But what about health insurance? At a time like this, you can't afford to not have coverage, so spend some time researching your options. You may be able to retain your existing insurance, albeit at a cost. Or your employer may agree to extend your coverage for a while and subsidize your premiums. It's certainly worth having that conversation.\n\nThough it's encouraging to see that most employees think their employers have handled the ongoing crisis well, that doesn't negate the fear of losing their jobs. If you're worried about layoffs, take the above steps. The more information you gather, the more empowered you'll feel at a time when so much uncertainty abounds.\n\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

                        "article_content": "As coronavirus outbreaks continue to ravage long-term care centers across the state, a strike has been averted for 6,000 nursing home workers who threatened a work stoppage at 64 facilities starting Friday.\n\nThe workers, members of SEIU Healthcare Illinois, announced a tentative agreement Thursday on a two-year contract that includes a $15 minimum wage for all workers, hazard pay during the pandemic, additional sick days and provisions ensuring that employees are not required to work without adequate equipment to protect themselves from the virus.\n\nDuring a virtual news conference Thursday, Greg Kelley, president of SEIU Healthcare Illinois Indiana Missouri & Kansas, noted that nursing homes have become \u201a\u00c4\u00fahotspots\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 where COVID-19 has spread rapidly and said the agreement will help \u201a\u00c4\u00fasafeguard the safety\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of both the workers and residents.\n\nFrancine Rico, a certified nursing assistant at Villa at Windsor Park in South Shore, told reporters that supplies are still limited at her facility, where 91 staff members and residents have tested positive for the coronavirus. Fifteen of them have died, according to data compiled by the Illinois Department of Public Health.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faOur members are still needing to use gowns and raincoats and use your mask for a week,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Rico.\n\nRep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill, bemoaned essential workers like Rico having to re-use protective gear, faulting the \u201a\u00c4\u00facomplete failure\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 by the federal government to control the supply.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen we call people essential workers \u201a\u00c4\u00ee we say they have to go to work \u201a\u00c4\u00ee then it is really the responsibility in this pandemic that we get them the materials and the protection that they need,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Schakowsky, who has introduced legislation to bolster protections for nursing home residents and workers amid the pandemic. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt is one of the most infuriating, unacceptable things that I have ever heard of.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nSchakowsky noted that 44% of COVID-19 deaths in Illinois are attributable to long-term care facilities and lauded the workers for taking a stand to further protect themselves and their patients.\n\nThe Illinois Association of Health Care Facilities, which represented the nursing homes in negotiations, said: \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhile negotiations have ended, this insidious virus has not. We are grateful a walkout was avoided, and that our heroic staff members will continue caring for our vulnerable seniors as we fight this battle together.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe agreement covers more than 10,000 members of SEIU Healthcare who provide care to residents at more than 100 nursing homes. SEIU Healthcare is an investor in Sun-Times Media.\n\nKelley said he hopes the contract will be ratified by next week."

                        "article_content": "Coronavirus May Mean Lights Out For Summer Camps This Year\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption PeopleImages/E+/Getty Images PeopleImages/E+/Getty Images\n\nSummer camps around the nation are grappling with whether or how they can open this summer, as the pandemic continues. The prospect is especially challenging for overnight camps, where hundreds of kids play, eat and sleep together, and the very idea of social distancing is completely anathema to the camp experience.\n\nLittle wonder a growing number of sleepaway camps have already capitulated to COVID-19.\n\n\"The cancellation of camp this summer is profoundly disappointing for all of us after what already feels like an eternity of frustration and uncertainty,\" wrote Shannon Donovan-Monti, executive director at Chimney Corners Camp in Western Massachusetts, in an email to parents this week. \"There are no words that can take away the heartbreak of depriving our children and ourselves of something that has given us such joy and connection to others.\"\n\nEleven-year old Maddie Prince was among the many Chimney Corners campers who took it hard. \"It makes me sad that I can't be with my friends,\" she said.\n\nCamp is where she \"grows up more,\" she said, and where she is happiest. \"You don't have any tech and it's really easy to forget all of your worries,\" she added.\n\nNational Will Summer Camps Open This Year? Will Summer Camps Open This Year? Listen \u00ac\u2211 4:52 4:52\n\n\"I would argue that kids need camp this summer more than ever before,\" said Dayna Hardin, president of CampGroup, which runs 15 camps from Maine to Michigan, including 13 overnight camps that are still hoping to open. She says the overnight experience might be just what the doctor ordered for kids who have been suffering through months of isolation and anxiety. And she argued that kids may actually be safer from infection at overnight camp than at home.\n\n\"We are looking at this like we are the castle,\" Hardin said. \"Our kids are going to enter the castle and we are going to pull up the drawbridge and we will be our own isolated community.\"\n\nBut a strict \"no in, no out\" policy would certainly crimp camps' style. It would mean no field trips, no visiting days and no socials or sports tournaments with other camps. Staff would have to remain on campus for days off. And laundry and food deliveries would pose challenges.\n\nCamp life inside the \"bubble,\" as some are calling it, would also change. Instead of playing tag, kids would have to fill their time with non-contact activities like making crafts.\n\n\"Camp is going to look very different,\" said Matt Fragala, managing principal consultant at Environmental Health & Engineering, the group hired by the American Camp Association (ACA) to recommend best practices and guidelines for camps. Specifics will depend on state and local mandates, but Fragala said recommendations will include constant disinfecting, spreading kids out for sleeping and eating at a distance and in shifts in the dining hall. The goal, Fragala said, is to \"control some of the mayhem the best way we can. It's going to be a change from business as usual at camp. But there's a balance we have to try to meet to keep everybody safe and to minimize potential risk.\"\n\nCamps are also expecting to have to split kids up into smaller units, said ACA president and CEO Tom Rosenberg. \"These would be like families where [kids] would be able to socialize somewhat normally,\" he said. \"But between the family circles, there will be physical distancing.\"\n\nThe same rule would apply to wearing face masks, according to Rosenberg. Campers would wear them when outside their \"family\" group, he said, and staff who interact with more than one \"family\" group, like a food service worker or an archery instructor, would likely have to wear a mask all day.\n\nCamps would be expected to regularly monitor campers and staff for symptoms of COVID-19, for example by taking temperatures every day. But whether camps would test for COVID-19 is an open question. Some camps see testing as a requirement; they won't even consider opening unless they could test kids before and during the session. But other camps say they would not test, relying on taking campers' temperatures daily and watching for other symptoms. That's an approach some parents find irresponsible.\n\n\"That keeps me up at night,\" said Fina Barouch, a Boston-area physician and parent of two campers. She said she will not allow her kids to go to camp.\n\n\"It only takes one person to be shedding virus when completely asymptomatic, and my concern is that this could turn into something like the nursing home pandemic, where it just spreads exponentially,\" Barouch said.\n\nThe CDC has issued its guidance for camps, recommending general precautions like social distancing, screening and extra disinfecting. The agency also directs camps to follow state and local laws, but in most cases camps are still waiting to hear what those will be, and they're growing increasingly frustrated that they don't have more information to help them make their decision.\n\nA few state and local governments have already decided to ban sleepaway camps this summer, including Georgia and Minnesota, and Connecticut is expected to do so. Officials in Vermont have indicated they want to allow overnight camps to open, with extra precautions that are still being worked out. But the vast majority of jurisdictions are still wrestling with the issue.\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said the issue comes up every day in conversation with other states.\n\n\"The tough part,\" he said, \"is figuring out, especially when it comes to some of the stuff that involves the joys of being a kid, figuring out some way to do this, where you have at least enough rules to make sure it can be done safely, but you don't destroy the whole spontaneous nature of what those are supposed to be about.\"\n\nIndeed, one camp director said an overnight camp that cuts so many core traditions would be like Disney World without the Magic Kingdom or Mickey Mouse.\n\nCamp consultant Lauren Kasnett Nearpass, co-founder of Summer 365, agrees that if the restrictions become so onerous that camp no longer feels like camp, it may no longer be worth it.\n\n\"If you have to remove the magic completely,\" she said, \"if it's going to look and feel so different, then perhaps you know, we just power forward to 2021.\"\n\nThe prospect of a watered-down camp experience gives pause even to die-hard campers like 15-year-old twins Sasha and Amanda Fine, who were looking forward to the perks and privileges they would enjoy as members of the oldest bunk at their camp this summer.\n\n\"Trust me, I want camp more than anyone,\" said Sasha. \"It's just that we can't have camp like this. Like it's taunting us.\"\n\nA month ago, Amanda said, her friends were all in favor of going to camp this summer no matter what. But now, she said, rather than a heavily compromised and shortened 2020, most would rather wait and have a \"normal\" summer in 2021."

                        "article_content": "Submitted by InfoBrics, authored by Johanna Ross, journalist based in Edinburgh, Scotland\u201a\u00c4\u00b6\n\nAs lockdown restrictions begin to be lifted, and we slowly aim to return to \u201a\u00c4\u00f2normality\u201a\u00c4\u00f4, questions are beginning to be asked about just what that normality should be. For never in recent history has a crisis so blatantly highlighted the inequalities in our society. And it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not just those on the left that think so. Veteran right-wing journalist Max Hastings, recently wrote a piece in which he said the coronavirus pandemic unleashed a demand for \u201a\u00c4\u00f2social, political and economic reform unprecedented in our memories\u201a\u00c4\u00f4. Even the former governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, recently admitted that when this is over, it would be \u201a\u00c4\u00f2reasonable\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 for people to \u201a\u00c4\u00f2demand improvements\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 in the quality of social provision and healthcare.\n\nThe reality is that Covid-19 has turned capitalists into socialists overnight, whether they like it or not. We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve kept hearing about governments making the choice between people and the economy. But people are the economy. Fundamentally, we need a change in priorities. The danger is that we return to a status quo from which another crisis will be born: this pandemic is not over yet, the threat of another one in future is real, and we need to have the social measures in place to enable us to deal with the fallout. Britain only has to compare itself statistically with other nations to realize that, along with the US, it has suffered particularly badly so far from this disease, and we have to ask why. An under-funded healthcare system, together with a 20% poverty rate surely plays a role.\n\nIn the midst of this \u201a\u00c4\u00f2war\u201a\u00c4\u00f4, with unemployment set to skyrocket, and families struggling to pay the rent and feed their children, Jeremy Corbyn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s agenda at the last election looks appealing. The renationalisation of key industries, a \u201a\u00c4\u00f2living\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 wage, a massive social housing programme, and immediate pay rise for public sector workers; somehow it doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t seem so \u201a\u00c4\u00f2radical\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 after all. The latest figures show that people living in poorer areas in Britain are twice as likely to succumb to coronavirus. What is the government doing about it? Not much. One of the Tory pledges in their 2019 election manifesto was to add five years on to life expectancy by 2035. But that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a tall order and would mean a significant change in policies \u201a\u00c4\u00ec not just in the short term for dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic \u201a\u00c4\u00ec but in the long term. We may be the world\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s fifth largest economy but Britain is currently ranked 29th in the global life expectancy index, behind a host of European countries.\n\nThe question is, what kind of post-Covid-19 future do we want? Already comparisons are being made with the aftermath of the Depression and the Second World War. After the Depression, President Roosevelt stated that \u201a\u00c4\u00f2heedless self-interest is\u201a\u00c4\u00b6bad economics\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 and that \u201a\u00c4\u00f2freedom from want\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 must be a key factor in policy-making. As for the UK, war-time leader Winston Churchill\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Conservative party was rejected in the 1945 election in favour of Labour, whose manifesto brandished the slogan \u201a\u00c4\u00f2The Labour party is a Socialist party and proud of it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4. The policies on which the party won were radical: nationalisation of the Bank of England, the coal and energy industries, public transport, and iron and steel. During the war, inequality was laid bare much in the same way as it has been during this current pandemic, and we saw the 1942 Beveridge report published, which laid the foundation for the welfare state \u201a\u00c4\u00ec the cornerstone of British society as we know it today.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00f2Goodbye globalisation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 read the front cover of this week\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Economist. It argues that globalisation was already on the rocks after the 2008 financial crash and Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s war with China; Covid-19 has been the final nail in the coffin. It predicts that global trade faces a troubling time ahead as governments, forced to underwrite national firms, will continue to favour them moving forward. But this can only be welcomed. Firstly, global trade generally means rich countries exploiting cheap workers abroad. Aside from welfare, a return to \u201a\u00c4\u00f2normality\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 would be disastrous for the planet. Satellite images have shown the remarkable changes which have taken place in our atmosphere across the globe as lockdowns were imposed on an international scale. Carbon dioxide emissions are set to have fallen this year by 8%, but this would have to occur every year for a decade in order to limit global warming to less than 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures.\n\nObviously, repeated and prolonged lockdown is not a solution, but some serious attempt must be made to address climate change before it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s too late. The coronavirus pandemic illustrates just how mother nature can floor us before we know it. She can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be underestimated. Indeed there has been something wonderful about the way nature has been able to reclaim its territory in this short time, with social media packed with viral videos of wild animals roaming the empty streets of our metropolises without a care in the world. It could be imagination, but somehow even the trees and bushes seem more green and luscious at this time.\n\nSo while governments take their first steps back towards \u201a\u00c4\u00f2normality\u201a\u00c4\u00f4, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s vital that, as a race, we don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t. This is a pivotal moment in our history, when the world is on pause, that we can think about what kind of future we want for our grandchildren, instead of being completely at the mercy of business, blindly bashing on, maximizing profit at whatever the cost. As William Beveridge proclaimed back in 1942 \u201a\u00c4\u00faA revolutionary moment in the world\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s history is a time for revolutions, not for patching.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\n\nLiked it?

                        "article_content": "SPRINGFIELD \u201a\u00c4\u00ee With the pandemic now nearing its fourth month in Illinois, most residents have made up their minds on whether to wear masks or other face coverings, but two downstate Republicans say they need a few days to think it over.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt boils down, in my book, to a matter of personal choice,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said state Rep. Brad Halbrook, R-Shelbyville.\n\nThat declaration of personal choice could soon be put to the test.\n\nThat\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s because next week the Illinois Legislature is scheduled to return to session for the first time since March 5, but that return is not without some changes. Notably, the Illinois House will meet at the Bank of Springfield Center, and legislators will be asked to wear face masks, submit to COVID-19 tests and temperature checks and adhere to social distancing measures.\n\nMulling an about-face, Halbrook and fellow Republican state Rep. Darren Bailey of downstate Xenia said they won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t commit to wearing masks when the House meets on Wednesday, potentially creating a standoff between them and Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan.\n\nPublic health officials, including those at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommend people wear cloth face coverings in \u201a\u00c4\u00fapublic settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 not only to prevent themselves from getting sick but also to prevent someone from unknowingly contracting the virus and spreading it to others.\n\nAnd on Friday, Republican House Leader Jim Durkin urged GOP legislators to abide by those rules.\n\nBut Bailey, who is suing Gov. J.B. Pritzker over the Chicago Democrat\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s stay-at-home order, said he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not concerned about contracting COVID-19 and that House members who are should stay away from Springfield next week.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faSo, if you are concerned about your health then, by all means, you should stay home or you wear a mask,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Bailey said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf someone doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want to wear a mask, then they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re simply taking the risk themselves.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nHalbrook said he is concerned that wearing a face covering could have negative health consequences for him. While Halbrook did not say whether he had an underlying health condition that could prevent him from wearing a mask, he said he wants to meet with his primary care doctor before he makes that decision.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI need to understand one-on-one with a professional what the dangers are, what is the upside, what\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the downside,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Halbrook said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI just want to have that conversation, and I have not been able to get to that person to have that conversation. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m just trying to make a well-informed decision.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nFor weeks, Republicans called for the General Assembly return, but it was only after Pritzker joined that chorus that fellow Democrats Madigan and Senate President Don Harmon agreed.\n\nIn a letter to Durkin announcing the return to Springfield, Madigan wrote that he was asking House members to follow \u201a\u00c4\u00faapproved precautions\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 from the Illinois Department of Public Health, which included wearing a face mask.\n\nWith Bailey and Halbrook as potential holdouts, Durkin sent a letter his GOP caucus on Friday asking members to \u201a\u00c4\u00faabide by best practices and safety protocols put forth by the Illinois Department of Public Health, which include temperature checks and wearing a protective mask.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe have a duty to not only uphold the Constitution but to also protect the health and well-being of our citizens and that includes our staff, House personnel, our colleagues, their families and members of the public,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the Western Springs Republican wrote.\n\nBailey and Halbrook are the first two Republicans to object.\n\nIn response, state Rep. Emanuel \u201a\u00c4\u00faChris\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Welch, D-Hillside, took to Twitter to call for the downstate Republicans and any other House members who refuse to wear face coverings to be \u201a\u00c4\u00fabanned from entering the convention center.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faYour intentional, reckless act to ignore the face mask guidance will risk lives. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m aware of members in our caucus and your caucus with newborns at home,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Welch tweeted.\n\nWhether any bare-faced legislators will be barred from the Bank of Springfield Center remains to be seen.\n\nMadigan spokesman Steve Brown wouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t say whether the guidelines spelled out by the Southwest Side Democrat will be enforced, only that \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe remain very hopeful that all members respect their colleagues and staff.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9"

As a result, the ruble lost some 20 percent of its value \u201a\u00c4\u00ec not as much as it could have given the fact that oil prices had shrunk almost threefold. According to the calculations of Gazprombank analysts, without foreign exchange interventions the dollar by the beginning of May would have been worth over 110 rubles.\n\n\u00ac\u00a9 Sputnik / Alexandr Demyanchuk Gazprombank logo in the pavilion hosting the 19th St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. (File)\n\nIn April, the value of the Russian central bank\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gold reserves grew by $6.244 billion, or 5.2 percent, reaching a value equivalent of over $126 billion, or 21.3 percent of the bank\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s total reserves, according to figures released by the regulator.\n\nPartly triggered by bullion\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s growing worth as a stable store of value amid the global economic slump, the soaring gold stocks caused total reserves to grow by 0.45 percent in the month of April, reaching a total of $566 billion.\n\nThe past four months have witnessed Russian reserves overall growing a net 2.1 percent.\n\nThe Russian Central Bank\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s international reserves, consisting of bullion, foreign currency reserves and special drawing rights assets, form a \u201a\u00c4\u00farainy day\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 investment fund for the Russian government.\n\nAccording to the World Gold Council (WGC), in 2018 Russia bought 274.3 tons of gold, in 2019 - 158.1, and so far in 2020 - 28 tons.\n\nThis week, gold has been trading at its highest since October 2012, at $1,764.55.\n\nIn global markets on 21 May, Gold eased 1 percent to $1,732.43 per ounce, while US gold futures shed 1.1 percent to $1,733.60 per ounce.\n\n\"Gold seems to have lost a little momentum since breaking above $1,750 and the rise in the dollar today doesn't seem to be helping,\" OANDA analyst Craig Erlam was cited as saying by Reuters.\n\nAnalysts are convinced this is not the limit, as precious metal is the most reliable investment tool in a crisis.\n\nThe developments come as investor confidence in US government bonds has been rapidly declining, with yields on the bonds stalling near all-time lows.\n\n\u00ac\u00a9 AP Photo / Patrick Semansky The U.S. Treasury Department building at dusk, Thursday, June 6, 2019, in Washington.\n\nAccording to Treasury Department data cited by the outlet on 15 May, foreign investors sold a record amount of US Treasury bonds and notes for the month of March.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt was a pretty large liquidation from a lot of the foreign accounts. And it makes a lot of sense because there was a lot of precautionary liquidation given all the uncertainty, especially in emerging market economies,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates analyst at TD Securities in New York was quoted as saying.\n\nForeigners were cited as selling $299.346 billion in Treasuries in March, a record high, compared with foreign buying of $4.885 billion in February.\n\nIn March, Saudi Arabia was one of the biggest sellers of Treasuries, with its holdings sinking to $159.1 billion, from $184.4 billion in February.\n\nThe Bank of Russia, which back in 2018 rapidly sold off the vast majority of its stash of US treasury bonds on the market, has slashed the remainder threefold - from $12.58 billion to $3.85 billion.\n\nThis represents less than one percent of the country's international reserves."

                        "article_content": "When I was growing up in the US during the 1960\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s, 1970\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s and 1980\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s, one of the prized freedoms we often and repeatedly talked about was the right to pray to God as one understands God, to be free both to go to the church of your church and to be free from going to the national church by requirement. Sure, this led to a pluralistic society, and sure, there are major challenges for each faith group in competition with other such groups and with the predominant secularism in the US, but believers have always had the freedom to pray and worship as they like.\n\nUntil now.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic brought in a wide series of restrictions against gathering in public places all over the world. In our own series on the rightness or wrongness of Orthodox Christian places of worship closing due to government regulations, we noted that the restriction on religious worship is not particularly directed at Christians only. Mecca is closed, the Indian, Japanese and some Jewish religious activities have all shown the effects of COVID-19 prevention regimes.\n\nHowever, in the United States, we now have elected leaders violating the principles set forth in the Constitution, namely, the very first Amendment:\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faCongress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free excercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nInstead, we have governors ordering churches closed, people fined and even arrested for going, and in places like Mississippi, the sentiment against Christian churchgoers has turned particularly nasty. A parish was burned to the ground, acccording to The New York Times:\n\nThe burning of a church in northern Mississippi this week is being investigated as arson because of a spray-painted message at the scene that seemed to criticize the church\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s defiance of coronavirus restrictions. First Pentecostal Church had sued the city of Holly Springs, Miss., which is about an hour southeast of Memphis, arguing that its stay-at-home order had violated the church\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s right to free speech and interfered with its members\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 ability to worship. After firefighters put out the blaze early Wednesday, the police found a message, \u201a\u00c4\u00faBet you stay home now you hypokrits,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 spray-painted on the ground near the church\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s doors, according to Maj. Kelly McMillen of the Marshall County Sheriff\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Department. A photograph of the graffiti also appears to show an atomic symbol with an \u201a\u00c4\u00faA\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in the center, which is sometimes used as a logo for atheist groups.\n\nOne thing this clearly proves is that bigots cannot spell correctly.\n\nBut it also proves there is a great deal of animosity against Christians. This kind of attack would not have taken place even ten years ago, but now the anti-Christian climate in the United States is such that incidents like this are looking for ways to happen.\n\nThis video shows how embedded anti-Christian attitudes are now in the press corps at the White House. Watch as Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany deftly and forcefully handles the ferocious accusations that go beyond First Amendment sensibilities.\n\nOn Friday, May 22nd, President Trump called on state governments to allow churches to open, and has also threatened to override any state that refuses to do so. Here is what he said, with emphasis added:\n\nThank you very much. At my direction, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is issuing guidance for communities of faith. I want to thank Dr. Redfield and the CDC for their work on this matter and all the other work they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been doing over the past what now seems like a long period of time. Today I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m identifying houses of worship, churches, synagogue and mosques as essential places that provide essential services. Some governors have deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential, but have left out churches and other houses of worship. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not right. So I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential. I call upon governors to allow our churches and places of worship to open right now. If there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s any question, they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to have to call me, but they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not going to be successful in that call. These are places that hold our society together and keep our people united. The people are demanding to go to church and synagogue, go to their mosque. Many millions of Americans embrace worship as an essential part of life. The ministers, pastors, rabbis, imams and other faith leaders will make sure that their congregations are safe as they gather and pray. I know them well. They love their congregations. They love their people. They don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want anything bad to happen to them or to anybody else. The governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important, essential places of faith to open right now for this weekend. If they don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t do it, I will override the governors. In America, we need more prayer, not less. Thank you very much. Thank you.\n\nPresident Trump has this basic point right: without prayer to God, our nation is sunk. And it is, indeed, amazing how vile and anti-Christian our supposed \u201a\u00c4\u00fabest and brightest\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 have turned out to be. Incidentally, the press and \u201a\u00c4\u00faExperts\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 are saying that the president has no power to make this stick. They are wrong. In the spirit of the First Amendment, he absolutely does have the power to make this order stick.\n\nLiked it?

                        "article_content": "Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s measures of success. But after a manic 3\u00ac\u03a9 years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.\n\nBy far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not going to play that game,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not uniform across states and across countries.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBut even beyond the death count, there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the official said.\n\nSome Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t been able to focus on getting the response right.\n\nTrump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSo it is a war and I define victory when it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said on May 1. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt can never be a total victory because too many people have died.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nWhen American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.\n\nOthers are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAllowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 argued one Republican close to the president.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sen. Lindsey Graham\n\nBut, he added, \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf things don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t look like they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re bouncing back by September, I think that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to be a problem.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe fear that Trump can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.\n\nWhen asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the \u201a\u00c4\u00faeconomic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nA spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.\n\nOthers are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)"

The Chicago area case was confirmed at Advocate Children\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Hospital, though it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unclear whether the child is being treated at the Oak Lawn or Park Ridge campus.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThis appears to be a very complex complication of COVID-19,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Dr. Frank Belmonte, the hospital\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s chief medical officer. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are currently learning new things about this virus every day. This is the first indication that children may be more negatively impacted than we first expected.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe mysterious sickness was first identified in children in Europe and is now beginning to crop up in the United States, according to a statement from Advocate, which noted that the illness has affected \u201a\u00c4\u00fachildren as young as two and well into the teens.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nIn New York, public health officials have identified 64 children with symptoms consistent with the illness. A bulletin issued Monday warned that diagnostic testing for COVID-19 could come back positive or negative and that cases may require both cardiac and respiratory support.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faEarly diagnosis and treatment are essential,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Belmonte. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf you have questions, you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll want to call your pediatrician, or in more serious cases, go to a pediatric emergency department.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9"

As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.\n\nH.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of \u201a\u00c4\u00fatesting and contact tracers\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to be sent directly to everyone\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state \u201a\u00c4\u00fafor other purposes,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 such as \u201a\u00c4\u00fasupport the quarantine of such contacts.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined \u201a\u00c4\u00fanational COVID health emergency.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real \"teeth\" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.\n\nIn light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.\n\nEligible recipients of funds include \u201a\u00c4\u00fafaith-based\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00faschool-based\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.\n\nWhat is Contract Tracing?\n\nTake a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.\n\nContract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:\n\nThe disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR.

If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called \u201a\u00c4\u00faconfirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 require no viral testing, and only \u201a\u00c4\u00fasuspicion of infection.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.\n\nIf contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of \u201a\u00c4\u00fapublic health safety,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new \u201a\u00c4\u00fawar on terror,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020.

At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.\n\nSo, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, \u201a\u00c4\u00faNATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.\n\nPlease take a strong action today by using the health freedom advocacy portal and campaign on Stand For Health Freedom, or use the widget below."

He explains that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the inflammation sparked by the Coronavirus, not the virus itself, that kills patients. Inflammation causes a condition called Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which damages the lungs so that patients, suffering fever, fatigue, and the sense that their inner chest is on fire, eventually cannot breathe without the help of a ventilator.\n\nThe University of Wisconsin in Madison has included intravenous Vitamin C as part of its treatment guideline. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s part of a combination therapy protocol developed in 2017 by Dr. Paul E. Marik at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk. Dr. Marik gives critically ill patients inexpensive, readily available intravenous doses of hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, and thiamine (\u201a\u00c4\u00faHAT\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 therapy) within 6 hours of entering an emergency room. In Dr. Marik\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s study, published in 2017 in the journal \u201a\u00c4\u00faChest\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 by the American College of Chest Physicians, his team reported that in the first 47 patients treated with HAT therapy the death rate was 8.5% compared to 40.4% in patients not treated with HAT. Further, in a recent study by Dr. Kory\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s team involving a large series of patients suffering septic shock, including many with pneumonia, they found that early IV administration of these same vitamins and steroids was critical to survival. The risk of mortality increased with each 6 hours of delay.\n\nWhen the Coronavirus pandemic hit China, Chinese doctors were quick to use intravenous Vitamin C. When their patients tested positive for COVID-19, the Chinese added 2 inexpensive, FDAapproved drugs hydroxychloroquine (anti-malarial) and zithromax (antibiotic) to the IV and gave patients oral doses of 2 supplements: melatonin and zinc. The combination likely worked given that their reported mortality rates are lower than reported elsewhere in the world The link to the Shanghai expert consensus on comprehensive care for COVID-19 patients is attached. The Chinese tried to do a clinical trial of IV Vitamin C, but Dr. Richard Z.Cheng, working with the investigators in Shanghai told Dr. Marik that it was very difficult to get patients to enter the trial. However, of the first 50 patients treated, no-one died!\n\nWhen COVID-19 cases hit Virginia, Dr. Marik used his full HAT protocol (IV hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, thiamine) on ARDS patients in the ICU, while also adding the drugs and supplements used by the Chinese. The results have been remarkable. He recently saved four COVID-19 patients, including an 86-year old man with heart disease who was admitted to the hospital on 100% oxygen, by using the protocol. (86-year old men with heart disease do not normally survive COVID-19!)\n\nDr. Joseph Varon at United General Hospital in Houston, Texas, is using the protocol and, to date, has saved 16 lives. He reports that they are getting off the ventilator in 48 hours instead of 10 - 21 days! That means far fewer hospital beds and ventilators needed \u201a\u00c4\u00ee as well as fewer coffins.\n\nThe big question is: Why aren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t many more U.S. hospitals adopting this protocol? \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe only reason I can give is that there is widespread, and often well-founded, bias amongst physicians against the use of vitamin therapy,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 says Dr. Kory. He adds, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe persistence of this bias is inexplicable given that the evidence is in plain sight.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 He points out that despite the publication of a major study of intravenous Vitamin C in ARDS (the syndrome that is killing patients with COVID-19), which reported dramatic reductions in mortality, days on the ventilator, and days in the ICU, only a minority of critical care doctors adopted the therapy as part of routine practice.\n\nOne hospital chain disallowed the use of steroids in the treatment of COVID-19. That's because doctors are taught that steroids increase the growth of viruses and that steroids harm patients with influenza. Drs. Marik, Varon, and Kory all agree that, for this reason, steroids should not be given early to a patient with influenza or coronavirus. But Dr. Kory says evidence does not show harm of steroids in previous coronavirus epidemics such as SARS and MERS, especially when given late inthe disease. When the diagnosis is COVID-19, and especially when the inflammatory response begins to cause deterioration in breathing or the need for a ventilator, steroids should be added. Thesteroids are in the formula to fight the life-threatening inflammation. In fact, all of the formula\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ingredients are needed, together, to get maximum life-saving results.\n\nNew York Internist Dr. Keith Berkowitz adds that, \u201a\u00c4\u00fain this time of crisis, when ventilators are in limited supply, hospitals are overwhelmed with patients, and medical staff lack adequate protective gear and are putting their lives on the line, every hospital needs to try this safe, low-cost and highly effective treatment that leading specialists know saves lives in acute respiratory distress syndrome. This is not the time to wait months for a vaccine or years for more test results. The important thing now is to keep patients off ventilators and to save lives. Period.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9"

The agency noted that they do not have any specific safety concerns about the product, but said that they still needed to do some research to ensure that the tests were safe.\n\nThe program in question is known as the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network (SCAN) and they are now being asked to put their operation on hold until proper authorization is obtained. This also means that patients who have already sent in their tests will not be able to receive their results until the authorization has been given. SCAN is promising that this shut down is only temporary.\n\nSCAN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s website stated that, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe FDA has not raised any concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of SCAN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s test, but we have been asked to pause testing until we receive that additional authorization.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nSCAN was sending out free test kits to potential patients, including people who were asymptomatic, hoping to obtain some data on how the coronavirus spreads through people who don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t show symptoms.\n\ntake our poll - story continues below Trump or Biden, who will win?

The United States has been slow to get started with mass testing, especially of asymptomatic individuals, and the tests are mostly controlled by government agencies like the CDC. The tests currently available have also been criticized for being inaccurate. Just last week, the FDA issued a warning about tests made by Abbott Laboratories, saying that they often gave falsely negative results.\n\nJohn Vibes is an author and journalist who takes a special interest in the counter culture, and focuses solutions-oriented approaches to social problems.

At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.\n\nSo, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, \u201a\u00c4\u00faNATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.\n\nPlease take a strong action today by using the health freedom advocacy portal and campaign on Stand For Health Freedom, or use the widget below."

                        "article_content": "After Alameda County health officials cautioned Tesla against reopening its California car factory yesterday, CEO Elon Musk tweeted today that the company would sue the county and move its headquarters out of state. Hours later, Tesla\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attorneys filed suit in US District Court in the Northern District of California seeking an injunction against the county\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s shelter-in-place order, because it \u201a\u00c4\u00facontradicts the Governor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Order to the extent it restricts the operation of business operating in the federal critical infrastructure sectors.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faTesla is filing a lawsuit against Alameda County immediately,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Musk said on Twitter. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe unelected & ignorant \u201a\u00c4\u00f2interim Health Officer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 of Alameda is acting contrary to the Governor, the President, our Constitutional freedoms & just plain common sense!\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nMusk has been a vocal critic of coronavirus shelter-in-place orders, saying at the company\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s April 29th earnings call that such restrictions were \u201a\u00c4\u00fafascist\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and not democratic. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are a bit worried about not being able to resume production in the Bay Area, and that should be identified as a serious risk,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Musk said. He also urged supporters on Twitter to \u201a\u00c4\u00faplease voice your disagreement as strongly as possible with Alameda County.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nAn Alameda County spokesperson said in a statement to The Verge on Saturday that the county Health Care Services Agency and Public Health Department have been \u201a\u00c4\u00facommunicating directly and working closely with the Tesla team on the ground in Fremont. This has been a collaborative, good faith effort to develop and implement a safety plan that allows for reopening while protecting the health and well-being of the thousands of employees who travel to and from work at Tesla\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s factory.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe spokesperson added that the team at Tesla had been responsive to guidance and recommendations \u201a\u00c4\u00faand we look forward to coming to an agreement on an appropriate safety plan very soon.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The statement, issued several hours after Musk\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s tweets, did not reference the Tesla CEO\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s comments or mention him by name.\n\nFrankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA. \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 9, 2020\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe appreciate that our residents and businesses have made tremendous sacrifices and that together we have been able to save lives and protect community health in our region,\u201a\u00c4\u00fa the statement continues. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt is our collective responsibility to move through the phases of reopening and loosening the restrictions of the Shelter-in-Place Order in the safest way possible, guided by data and science.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nTesla announced plans to resume \u201a\u00c4\u00falimited operations\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 at its Fremont facility yesterday, which would bring back about 30 percent of its workforce. But officials in Alameda County, where Fremont is located, said yesterday that it was still under a shelter-in-place order and that Tesla it didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t meet its criteria to reopen. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe have not said that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s appropriate to move forward,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Erica Pan, Alameda County\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s health officer, according to Bloomberg.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom said Thursday that state-level guidance allowing manufacturing to resume some production didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t supersede county-level restrictions. The company had unsucessfully tried to argue that Tesla\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s production should be considered critical infrastructure.\n\nThe Fremont plant, where Tesla assembles its Model 3, Model S, Model X, and Model Y vehicles, was temporarily closed March 23rd to comply with the shelter-in-place order. Tesla reduced pay for all its US salaried employees as of April 13th and put most hourly workers who can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t work remotely on unpaid furlough. What would happen to the roughly 10,000 workers at the Fremont plant if Tesla were to move operations out of state as Musk tweeted, was unclear.\n\nBoth Tesla and Musk settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2018 over Musk\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s tweets about taking Tesla private. Then, in 2019, the terms of the settlement were renegotiated. Under the new terms, a company lawyer must approve Musk\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s tweets about certain parts of Tesla\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s business before Musk sends them. That includes any announcement that would trigger a filing of the form 8-K, which is used for announcing unscheduled material events, to the SEC. As of this writing, Tesla has not filed an 8-K about Musk\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposed factory move.\n\nTesla did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nUPDATE May 9th, 5:16PM ET: Adds statement from Alameda County spokesperson and includes additional tweet from Musk.\n\nUPDATE May 9th, 5:40PM ET: Adds details of Tesla lawsuit filed against Alameda County"

                        "article_content": "HOUSTON \u201a\u00c4\u00ee As families marked Mother\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Day in a time of social distancing and isolation due to the coronavirus pandemic, leaders balanced optimism they could loosen lockdowns that have left millions unemployed against the threat of a second wave of infections.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin predicted the American economy would rebound in the second half of this year from unemployment rates that rival the Great Depression. Another 3.2 million U.S. workers applied for jobless benefits last week, bringing the total over the last seven weeks to 33.5 million.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI think you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to see a bounce-back from a low standpoint,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Mnuchin, speaking on \u201a\u00c4\u00faFox News Sunday.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBut the director of the University of Washington institute that created a White House-endorsed coronavirus model said the moves by states to re-open businesses \u201a\u00c4\u00fawill translate into more cases and deaths in 10 days from now.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Dr. Christopher Murray of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation said states where cases and deaths are going up more than expected include Illinois, Arizona, Florida and California.\n\nMany families faced their first Mother\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Day without loved ones lost in the pandemic. Others sent good wishes from a safe distance or through phone and video calls.\n\nThe virus has caused particular suffering for the elderly, with more than 26,000 deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, according to an Associated Press tally.\n\nAt a senior center in Smyrna, Georgia, 73-year-old Mary Washington spoke to her daughter Courtney Crosby and grandchild Sydney Crosby through a window.\n\nIn Grafton, West Virginia, where the tradition of Mother\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Day began 112 years ago, the brick building now known as the International Mother\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Day Shrine held its first online-only audience. Anna Jarvis first held a memorial service for her mother and all mothers on the second Sunday of May in 1908.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faSheltered safely at home with the family together would be viewed by Anna Jarvis as exactly the way she wanted Mother\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Day to be observed,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Marvin Gelhausen, chairman of the shrine\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s board of trustees, in an address on YouTube.\n\nMatilda Cuomo, the mother of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, called into her son\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s daily briefing so he and his three daughters could wish her a happy Mother\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Day.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI am so blessed as many mothers today are,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said.\n\nAndrew Cuomo, whose state is the deadliest hot spot for the virus in the U.S., said he looked forward to getting back to normal. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to have fun, and then you can spend more time with me. I know I am your favorite,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said in a playful dig at his siblings.\n\nHe also announced two policy reversals a day after an Associated Press report in which residents\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 relatives, watchdog groups and politicians from both parties alleged he was not doing enough to counter the surge of deaths in nursing homes, where about 5,300 residents have died. Nursing home staff in New York will now have to undergo COVID-19 tests twice a week and facilities will no longer be required to take in hospital patients who were infected.\n\nThe U.S. has seen 1.3 million infections and nearly 80,000 deaths, the most in the world by far, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Worldwide, 4 million people have been reported infected and more than 280,000 have died, over half of them in Europe, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nIn the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a modest easing of the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s coronavirus lockdown but urged citizens not to surrender the progress already made. The country has recorded the most virus deaths in Europe at over 31,900.\n\nThose in the construction or manufacturing industries or other jobs that can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be done at home \u201a\u00c4\u00fashould be actively encouraged to go to work\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 this week, he said. Johnson, who has taken a tougher line after falling ill himself with what he called \u201a\u00c4\u00fathis devilish illness,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 set a goal of June 1 to begin re-opening schools and shops if the U.K. can control new infections and the transmission rate of each infected person.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will be driven not by mere hope or economic necessity,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to be driven by the science, the data, and public health.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nGermany, which managed to push new infections below 1,000 daily before deciding to loosen restrictions, has seen regional spikes in cases linked to slaughterhouses and nursing homes. Health officials say the number of people each confirmed virus patient infects rose above 1 again, reflecting a renewed increase in cases. The number must be below 1 for outbreaks to decline.\n\nFrance is letting some younger students go back to school Monday after almost two months out. Attendance won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be compulsory right away. Residents of some Spanish regions will be able to enjoy limited seating at bars, restaurants and other public places Monday, but Madrid and Barcelona, the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s largest cities, will remain shut down.\n\nChina, where the virus was first detected, reported 14 new cases Sunday, its first double-digit rise in 10 days. Eleven of 12 domestic infections were in the northeastern province of Jilin, prompting authorities to raise the threat level in one of its counties, Shulan, to high risk, just days after downgrading all regions to low risk.\n\nAuthorities said the Shulan outbreak originated with a 45-year-old woman who had no recent travel or exposure history but spread it to her husband, three sisters and other relatives. Train services in the county were suspended.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faEpidemic control and prevention is a serious and complicated matter, and local authorities should never be overly optimistic, war-weary or off-guard,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Jilin Communist Party secretary Bayin Chaolu.\n\nSouth Korea reported 34 more cases as new infections linked to nightclubs threaten its hard-won gains against the virus. It was the first time that South Korea\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s daily infections were above 30 in about a month.\n\nJordans reported from Berlin. Associated Press journalists around the world contributed."

She tweeted this bold thought to thousands of her followers, commenting on the story of a woman who had to abandon her lucrative job in favor of her husband, who could not handle full-time parenting, labeling the man \"absolutely pathetic\".\n\nDespite not feeling for the hero of the story, netizens slammed Ford for being way too brutal, stressing that no mistakes or failures can excuse such things to say. Having received the wave of disproval, Ford only went on to remark how \"fragile\" men are if they react like that.\n\nHonestly, the corona virus isn't killing men fast enough. \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Clementine Ford \uf8ff\u00fc\u00df\u00fc\u201a\u00c4\u00e7\u201a\u00f4\u00c4\u00d4\u220f\u00e8 (@clementine_ford) May 23, 2020\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00e3Some people felt personally attacked by the writer's harsh words.\n\nThis isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t funny. Please delete it.\n\n\n\nI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m over 60, overweight, and diagnosed with heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes. If I get COVID-19, I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll croak as quickly as you could wish.\n\n\n\nIt really is not funny. \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Charlie Galvin (@cxarli) May 23, 2020\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00e3Some noted that the tweet could be compared with racism, ableism and hate speech.\n\nClementine, is this a similar joke to: 'Honestly, the corona virus isn't killing black people fast enough' or 'Honestly, the corona virus isn't killing disabled people fast enough'or 'Honestly, the corona virus isn't killing health care workers fast enough'? \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Dr Pete Jones (@fatwhitebloke) May 23, 2020\n\nI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve supported your position so many times in the past, but this is an appalling thing to say. \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Marissa Kate (@DrMarissaKate) May 23, 2020\n\nI note Clementines books increased in sales over the Covid period. People suggested it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s because we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re reading more at home. I suggested it was a direct link to the shortage of toilet paper. \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Adam Denniss (@adam_denniss) May 23, 2020\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00e3Some pointed out that while Ford was apparently standing with women, she ended up insulting both genders.\n\nThis take makes no sense if you actually read the article which takes both men and women far more seriously than your callous response does. Imagine wishing single-motherhood on a woman in a time of Covid. The irony of this tweet is that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s anti men AND women. \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Chlo\u221a\u00a9 S. Valdary \uf8ff\u00fc\u00ec\u00f6 (@cvaldary) May 23, 2020\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00e3Another sad irony of the incident is that several studies that have been conducted globally have shown that men tend to actually die from COVID-19 more often, although the potential to overcome the disease is the same for both genders. According to research by University College London, based on the data collected on 206,128 patients, men were twice as likely to require intensive care, and 60 percent more likely to die after being infected wIth COVID-19.\n\nFacing strong backlash, Ford deleted the tweet, apologizing in a subsequent series of tweets for not \"framing her argument\" clearly and describing her tweet as \"poorly judged\". It was noted by many, however, that she remained committed to her assertion."

Workers and consumers will not return to offices, stores and restaurants if companies cannot be held accountable when they fail to prioritize health and safety. If no one is responsible, no one is safe. People will not go back to their normal routines if they don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t feel safe.\n\nA recent poll found that nearly two-thirds of voters across party lines oppose legislation giving guaranteed immunity to businesses, and even small business owners think it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unnecessary. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce \u201a\u00c4\u00ee which has been demanding legal immunity for decades \u201a\u00c4\u00ee inadvertently revealed in its own polling that \u201a\u00c4\u00faliability protection\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 was the lowest priority of small business owners.\n\nAs the president of an association representing thousands of trial lawyers, I know that there won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be a flood of lawsuits, and the Chamber of Commerce knows this, too. Proving that a company acted unreasonably and that those exact actions caused harm will be difficult. It will be extremely challenging to prove that a victim was exposed and got sick in one specific place given the number of places or people from which or from whom that victim could have been exposed.\n\nThe cases that move forward will be the ones like those involving nursing homes that kept sick workers on the job resulting in mass death, or food processing plants that offered bonuses to sick employees who came to work.\n\nOUR VIEW:Coronavirus lawsuits immunity requires public health guidelines\n\nNational Consumers League:Immunizing all companies would hurt both workers, consumers\n\nEven then, blanket immunity won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t help those sick workers or the families of those who died \u201a\u00c4\u00ee it will just shield corporations that failed to take reasonable steps.\n\nLet\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s make the health of workers and consumers the top priority and then watch our businesses and economy flourish. We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re all in this together.\n\nBruce Stern is president of the American Association for Justice.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page."

A second wave of tech-assisted pandemic surveillance tools is on its way, this time with the imprimatur of tech giants Apple and Google. But those face their own issues, among them potential accuracy problems and the fact that they won't share any information with governments that could help track the spread of the illness.\n\nContact tracing is a pillar of infection control. It's traditionally conducted by trained public health workers who interview those who may have been exposed, then urge them to get tested and isolate themselves. Some estimates call for as many as 300,000 U.S. workers to do the work effectively, but so far those efforts have lagged.\n\nApple is reopening some stores this week:Expect to wear a mask, have temperature checked\n\nMore:Apple, Google will warn you if you've been exposed to COVID-19. Here's how.\n\nOther tech companies like Salesforce have offered database tools to assist manual tracing efforts, although those also raise privacy concerns because of the need to collect and store detailed information about people's social connections, health status and whereabouts.\n\nPrivacy concerns over tracking\n\nPrivacy advocates warn that the danger of creating new government surveillance powers for the pandemic could lead to much bigger problems in the future. In a new policy paper shared with The Associated Press, the American Civil Liberties Union is warning state governments to tread more carefully and establish stricter privacy procedures before deploying technology meant to detect and curb new coronavirus outbreaks.\n\nEven the most privacy-minded tools, such as those to be released soon by Apple and Google, require constraints so that they don't become instruments of surveillance or oppression. \"The risks of getting it wrong are enormous,\" said Neema Singh Guliani, a senior legislative counsel with the ACLU.\n\nACLU's report says the worst location-tracking technology should be rejected outright, such as apps that track individual movements via satellite-based GPS technology and feed sensitive personal data into centralized government databases. \"Good designs don't require you to gather people's location information and store that,\" Singh Guliani said.\n\nShe urged governments to set rules addressing both privacy and efficacy so that surveillance tools don't interfere with more conventional public health methods.\n\nUtah, North Dakota and South Dakota were the first U.S. states to launch voluntary phone apps that enable public health departments to track the location and connections of people who test positive for the coronavirus. But governors haven't had much luck getting the widespread participation needed for them to work effectively.\n\nThe state with the highest known rate of participation so far is South Dakota, where last week about 2% of residents had the Care19 app on their phones. Last week was also the first time it recorded a single infection. The same app is getting even less support in North Dakota.\n\n\"This is a red state,\" said Crystal Wolfrum, a paralegal in Minot, North Dakota, who says she's one of the only people among her neighbors and friends to download the app. \"They don't want to wear masks. They don't want to be told what to do. A lot of people I talk to are, like, 'Nope, you're not going to track me.' \"\n\nWolfrum said she's doubtful that the app will be useful, both because of people's wariness and its poor performance. She gave it a bad review on Google's app store after it failed to notice lengthy shopping trips she made one weekend to Walmart and Target stores.\n\nNorth Dakota is now looking at starting a second app based on the Apple-Google technology. \"It was rushed to market,\" because of the urgent need, Vern Dosch, the state's contact tracing facilitator, told KFYR-TV in Bismarck. \"We knew that it wouldn't be perfect.\"\n\nTracking without revealing identity\n\nThe ACLU is taking a more measured approach to the Apple and Google method, which will use Bluetooth wireless technology to automatically notify people about potential COVID-19 exposure without revealing anyone's identity to the government.\n\nBut even if the app is described as voluntary and personal health information never leaves the phone, the ACLU says it's important for governments to set additional safeguards to ensure that businesses and public agencies don't make showing the app a condition of access to jobs, public transit, grocery stores and other services.\n\nAmong the governments experimenting with the Apple-Google approach are the state of Washington and several European countries.\n\nSwiss epidemiologist Marcel Salath\u221a\u00a9 said all COVID-19 apps so far are \"fundamentally broken\" because they collect too much irrelevant information and don't work well with Android and iPhone operating software. Salath\u221a\u00a9 authored a paper favoring the privacy-protecting approach that the tech giants have since adopted, and he considers it the best hope for a tool that could actually help isolate infected people before they show symptoms and spread the disease.\n\n\"You will remember your work colleagues but you will not remember the random person next to you on a train or really close to you at the bar,\" he said.\n\nOther U.S. governors are looking at technology designed to supplement manual contact-tracing efforts. As early as this week, Rhode Island has said it is set to launch a contact-tracing database system mostly built by software giant Salesforce, which has said it is also working with Massachusetts, California, Louisiana and New York City on a similar approach.\n\nSalesforce says it can use data-management software to help trained crews trace \"relationships across people, places and events\" and identify virus clusters down to the level of a neighborhood hardware store. It will rely on manual input of information gathered through conversations by phone, text or email.\n\n\"It's only as good as a lot of us using it,\" Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo said at a news conference last week. \"If 10% of Rhode Island's population opts in, this won't be effective.\" The state hasn't yet outlined what people are expected to opt into.\n\nThe ACLU hasn't yet weighed in on the Salesforce model, but has urged contact-tracing public health departments to protect people from unnecessary disclosure of personal information and to not criminalize the requirement for self-isolation."

                        "article_content": "Illinois\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 peak period of COVID-19 deaths could stretch into early June \u201a\u00c4\u00ec or possibly even July.\n\nAnd that could mean 50 to 150 Illinoisans losing their lives to the coronavirus a day \u201a\u00c4\u00ec or possibly as many as 300 each day.\n\nThose were some of the grim estimates Gov. J.B. Pritzker delivered from his own home on Monday, a mix of troubling projections coupled with a few optimistic signs of progress for parts of the state outside the Chicago area.\n\nThe daily death toll Monday was 54, at the low end of the projections for the peak period. But that follows an especially deadly week, and it was announced amid a new round of scientific modeling.\n\nAnd those dire projections come at an extremely inopportune time for the Democratic governor, who is facing criticism from Republican legislators, unemployed workers who appear stuck in limbo and President Donald Trump.\n\nIt also comes as many in Illinois are suffering from cabin fever, growing increasingly restless over their lives having been disrupted for more than eight weeks.\n\nFor the first time Monday, Pritzker delivered his daily briefing from his home office \u201a\u00c4\u00ee a drawing of his late mother behind him \u201a\u00c4\u00ee as he broadcast live after a senior staffer tested positive for coronavirus. The governor said he himself has tested negative twice for coronavirus.\n\nThe governor also offered some good news along with his bad news projections. After announcing his reopening plan last week that divides the state into four regions and evaluates phases of re-openings based on health metrics, Pritzker said all regions except for the Northeast region \u201a\u00c4\u00faare on pace\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to be able to move to the next phase come May 29, the last day of the stay-at-home executive order.\n\nThe next phase, Phase 3, allows a number of businesses to reopen, with the use of \u201a\u00c4\u00faface coverings as the norm,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 including non-essential manufacturing and some non-essential businesses, including barber shops and salons.\n\nBut in the Northeast region, home to Chicago and Cook County, the positivity rate \u201a\u00c4\u00ee the number of positive cases compared to tests taken \u201a\u00c4\u00ee remains too high. Still, the governor signaled there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s still time to get that number lower. His plan in part entails 14 days of a positivity rate under 20%.\n\nIn total, 3,459 people have died of coronavirus in Illinois \u201a\u00c4\u00ee 803 of them last week. As of Monday, the state also reported 1,266 new cases, bringing the total of positive cases to 79,007. The state received 12,441 tests results.\n\nIn late April, Pritzker\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office released a COVID-19 projection and worst-case fatality scenario based on scientific modeling that predicted a range of 50 to 150 deaths per day into early May. That projection was created by researchers from the Illinois Department of Public Health, as well as researchers from Northwestern University, the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nThe latest projection shows Illinois is indeed in a peak period for coronavirus deaths, but it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s less like a peak and more like a plateau.\n\nThe death range remains between 50 and 150 a day in models from both the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Northwestern University, however, is projecting a range of 50 to 300 daily deaths. The University of Chicago predicts the state seeing a death plateau until July, while both Northwestern and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are predicting it could last until June.\n\nLea este art\u221a\u2260culo en espa\u221a\u00b1ol en La Voz Chicago, un servicio presentado por AARP Chicago.\n\nBeginning on April 23, the state saw 11 days in that originally predicted death range. On May 4, 46 deaths were reported. On May 5, the state saw its worst day with 176 fatalities. And since May 6, the state has consistently seen between 50 and 150 deaths a day, which is what the modelers predicted.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t passed our peak yet. We have seen more stability in our numbers, but so far, we are not seeing significant declines in key metrics like hospitalization,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Pritzker said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe updates to our models reflect that data.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nPritzker said the time frame of \u201a\u00c4\u00faplateauing near a peak\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 into mid-May \u201a\u00c4\u00fahas been expanded from mid-May into mid-June.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIn many ways, this news is disheartening,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Pritzker said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe have made great progress, but it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s forced us to remain at a moderated though still high level of key metrics for this extended period. A pushing out of our estimated peak is a natural consequence of flattening the curve. Remember that no one can truly stop this virus without a vaccine. But what we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been aiming to do since early March is slow down the exponential rate of transmission.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe slowing down, he said, has helped health care workers to treat those with coronavirus and give pharmaceutical researchers time to develop effective treatments and ultimately a vaccine.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faPushing the peak down and therefore to a longer time frame might not sound like good news to some, but I promise you it is saving lives,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Pritzker said.\n\nThe number of COVID-19 patients entering ICU beds went up by 16, from Saturday to Sunday night, according to Pritzker\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office. The number of ventilators being used by coronavirus patients also increased by 21, and the total number of COVID-19 patients increased by 26 patients.\n\nThe positivity rate statewide as of Monday is 10.17%. In the Northeast region, which includes Cook County and Chicago, the positivity rate is about 22%.\n\nMeanwhile, Pritzker\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s administration said the state has not yet received a shipment of swabs and viral transport media from the federal government. That shipment was anticipated in early May but has not yet arrived. The governor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s administration is also asking for federal help in obtaining surgical gowns, which are going fast, they said."

                        "article_content": "\n\nThere is a dire need for financial support of healthcare providers and facilities as they continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, now affecting the United States the most drastically. In response, the President signed the bipartisan CARES Act on March 27, 2020, providing much-needed relief funds to hospitals and other healthcare providers on the frontlines of the fight against coronavirus. As part of the recently announced CARES Act, $100 billion will be appropriated to create a Public Health Social Service Emergency Fund with an ultimate goal of preventing, preparing for, and responding to the coronavirus outbreak both domestically and on an international scale.\n\nPer the Act, funding will be dedicated to reimbursing healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 to alleviate some of the financial burden many providers are experiencing. Part of this relief payment will focus on ensuring that uninsured Americans have access to testing and treatment, and that medical professionals providing the care are reimbursed for their work. The Department of Health and Human Services has published detailed criteria for the process of distribution of funds under the Act as well as information about eligibility requirements, outlined below.\n\nImmediate Relief Funding\n\nRecognizing the urgent need for the delivery of financial relief, the HHS immediately infused $30 billion into the American healthcare system. Payments are slated to arrive via direct deposit beginning April 10, 2020 to eligible providers throughout the system. Note, these are direct payments, not loans and will not need to be repaid, the HHS emphasizes.\n\nEligibility for Immediate Relief Payments\n\nPer guidance from the HHS, all facilities and providers that received Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) reimbursements in 2019 are eligible to receive payments from this initial rapid distribution. Payments to practices that are part of larger medical groups will be sent to the group\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s central billing office, while all relief payments will be made to the billing organization according to its Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).\n\nIn order to be eligible to receive these funds, providers must not seek to collect of out-of-pocket payments from a COVID-19 patient that are greater than what they would be otherwise had the care been provided by an in-network practitioner. If a practice had to halt business operations as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, providers may still be eligible to receive funds if they provided diagnoses, testing, or care for patients with possible or confirmed cases of COVID-19. Per the HHS, \u201a\u00c4\u00faCare does not have to be specific to treating COVID-19. HHS broadly views every patient as a possible case of COVID-19.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe immediate relief payments hope to alleviate providers in hard-hit COVID-19 areas and those who are struggling to keep their practice open due to delayed care and widespread cancellations of elective procedures.\n\nPayment Distributions\n\nPayment distributions will be based on the provider\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s or practice\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s share of total Medicare FFS reimbursements for the year 2019; that year, the total FFS payments were approximately $484 billion. Providers can estimate their anticipated payment by dividing their 2019 Medicare FFS (excluding Medicare Advantage) payments \u201a\u00c4\u00ec which can be obtained from their organization\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s revenue management system \u201a\u00c4\u00ec by $484 billion and multiplying that ratio by $30 billion.\n\nReceiving Payments\n\nIn partnership with UnitedHealth Group (UHG), the HHS will provide rapid payments to eligible providers, as described above, to distribute the initial round of funding. Providers will be paid via their Automated Clearing House account information on file with UHG or the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and can expect to receive payments via Optum Bank with \u201a\u00c4\u00faHHSPAYMENT\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 as the payment description. Providers who receive reimbursements from CMS via paper check can expect to receive a paper check in the mail within the next few weeks.\n\nProviders must sign an attestation confirming receipt of the funds and agreeing to the terms and conditions of payment within 30 days of receipt. The Terms and Conditions of the funding can be found on the CMS website. If the payment is not returned within 30 days, the HHS will view this as an acceptance of the Terms and Conditions. However, if a provider does not wish to comply with the Terms and Conditions, they must contact HHS within 30 days of receipt of payment and then return the full payment to HHS.\n\nDifferent Types of Providers\n\nAll relief payments are being made to providers according to their tax identification number (TIN). Large organizations will receive payments for each of their billing TINs that bill Medicare, and should look to the part of their organization that handles Medicare billing to identify details on Medicare payments for 2019. Employed physicians should not expect to receive an individual payment directly; instead, their employer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s organization will receive the relief payment as the billing organization. Similarly, individual physicians and providers in a group practice are unlikely to receive individual payments directly; the group practice will receive the relief fund payment as the billing organization. Solo practitioners who bill Medicare will receive a payment under the TIN they use to bill Medicare.\n\nThe Remaining $70 Billion\n\nAs part of the $100 billion guaranteed by the CARES Act, the remaining $70 billion will be comprised of targeted distributions focused on providers in areas particularly impacted by the virus, rural providers, providers of services with lower shares of Medicare reimbursement or who predominantly serve the Medicaid population, as well as providers requesting reimbursement for the treatment of uninsured Americans. More guidance is expected on the structure of these payments in the coming weeks.\n\nCOVID-19 Medical Expenses\n\nThe federal government is taking measures to ensure Americans are not surprised by medical expenses and are protected against financial obstacles that might prevent them from seeking care or getting tested and treated for COVID-19. A portion of the Provider Relief Fund will be used to reimburse healthcare providers at Medicare rates for COVID-related treatment of the uninsured. However, providers are prohibited from \u201a\u00c4\u00fabalance billing\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 any patient for COVID-related treatment in order to be eligible.\n\nIn addition, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act requires private insurers to cover an insurance plan member\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s cost-sharing payments for COVID-19 testing. Further, the government has secured commitments from private insurers \u201a\u00c4\u00ec such as Humana, Cigna, UnitedHealthGroup, and the Blue Cross Blue Shield system \u201a\u00c4\u00ec to waive cost-sharing payments for treatment related to COVID-19 for its members and make medical care more accessible.\n\nHeavily anticipated by providers across the nation, the latest guidance helps to clarify eligibility, distribution, and payment concerns regarding the Provider Relief Fund. Eligible practices and providers may soon expect to receive payments from the immediate round of funding. In the meantime, medical professionals can access more information about and the latest developments concerning the CARES Act Provider Relief Fund here."

                        "article_content": "Today, as America faces a difficult debate about \u201a\u00c4\u00fareopening\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 state economies during the coronavirus pandemic, The New York Times seemingly offered a helpful piece of guidance. The paper\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s opinion section published a visualization of how people engage with different businesses like bars and gyms, estimating their risk of infection at each. Alarmingly, it dubbed some of these places dangerous \u201a\u00c4\u00fasuper-spreader businesses\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ee warning that \u201a\u00c4\u00fathrough the lens of contagion, a yoga class, a busy corner store, or a crowded neighborhood bar may look a lot like a wet market in China.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBut at least in this story, the real worry isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t contagion. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the sweeping assumptions being trained on some very limited data. And it doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t say much about whether your local bar can avoid serving coronavirus with its Coronas. That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s because the story doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t include any infection data.\n\nLocation data can track patterns, but not whether they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re still relevant\n\nThe Times story is written by four professors at the University of Chicago, who aggregated anonymized phone location data from April of 2019. Using that data, they plotted how people flowed through locations that corresponded to businesses \u201a\u00c4\u00ee learning which kinds of stores saw customers linger the longest, which drew the biggest crowds, and which squeezed the most people into the smallest spaces. They bolstered that data with surveys asking how much participants interacted with other people or touched shared surfaces in these places.\n\nThe new coronavirus is spreading through the US, and several states have made emergency declarations. The World Health Organization has declared it a pandemic. Here are the basics: Everything you need to know about the coronavirus\n\nThe tracking project produced some interesting factoids. Denny\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s and the Original Pancake House served similar numbers of people for similar amounts of time, but the latter saw a breakfast rush that produced more crowding. People stayed twice as long at electronics stores as lawn and garden stores \u201a\u00c4\u00ee the authors speculate that \u201a\u00c4\u00fayou don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t linger over fertilizer.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBut data from a year ago might tell us very little about the present or future. Many of these businesses have either been closed for weeks or drastically altered their operations. They\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll probably reopen (if they reopen at all) under restrictions that render a lot of these observations moot, like spacing rules that will stop those large brunch crowds or arrangements that decrease close-range interactions and shared surfaces.\n\nEven assuming GPS records perfectly track who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s inside or outside a building \u201a\u00c4\u00ee not a given \u201a\u00c4\u00ee we don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know if they reflect how post-pandemic consumers will behave. People might maintain those old browsing styles, but they might also consciously avoid lingering anywhere, or the coronavirus might produce unpredictable new patterns. (For all we know, if everybody\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s planting a COVID-19 victory garden, maybe they will linger over fertilizer.) People\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s safety doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t hinge on how they behaved in stores and restaurants a year ago, but about how well a given business can adapt to promote new habits and minimize their risk.\n\nWithout infection data, naming \u201a\u00c4\u00f2super-spreading\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 businesses is a huge stretch\n\nThe authors acknowledge that limitations exist, and they note that \u201a\u00c4\u00fathese data alone cannot tell us which businesses to open first, and we can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t simplify all these different metrics into a \u201a\u00c4\u00f2yes\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 or \u201a\u00c4\u00f2no\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 decision on any single business.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 But this uncertainty doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t make it into the overall framing of the story, particularly the claim that certain businesses are \u201a\u00c4\u00fasuper-spreaders\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ee which is not just an oversimplification, but an absurd rhetorical stretch.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faSuper-spreader\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 is normally reserved for a person or place that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s linked to dozens or hundreds of COVID-19 cases, including a funeral in Georgia, a party in Connecticut, and numerous meatpacking plants, nursing homes, and prisons. The Times editorial co-opts it for businesses that might be risky compared to other stores and restaurants. And it does this without using hard data to establish how much each of its risk factors practically matters, not just whether they hypothetically make infection more likely. We have no idea how good the assumptions of this model are.\n\nIn fact, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s extrapolating danger based on a painfully incomplete knowledge of the coronavirus. Epidemiologists know the mechanics of how the virus can spread, but they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not sure what\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s specifically driving many infections and how they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re affected by a multitude of environmental factors. Countries\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 rapidly-expanding contact tracing programs can help solve that mystery by finding links between cases. But beyond facts like extreme crowding and poor ventilation being dangerous, there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not a precise risk assessment right now for different densities and exposure times.\n\nThere are huge gaps in our understanding of coronavirus\n\nIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s normal for research and reporting to include simplifications or caveats. And mis-evaluating Red Lobster\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s pandemic fitness is less pernicious than, say, promoting drugs that probably don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t work. But it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s bad to pitch simple conclusions (like \u201a\u00c4\u00fabookstores are high-risk\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 or \u201a\u00c4\u00faflorists are safe,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to name two of the model\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s assertions) as policy recommendations when they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re backed up by so little evidence and so much speculation, especially when people are grasping for advice about a deadly and often baffling disease.\n\nWarnings \u201a\u00c4\u00ee or reassurances \u201a\u00c4\u00ee about coronavirus can become conventional wisdom even if they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re mostly speculative. One pre-print research paper with flashy graphics, for instance, seemed to show joggers and cyclists barreling down streets in a vast miasmatic breath cloud. The paper was an aerodynamic simulation that didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t establish whether the air could actually infect bystanders. But it was still widely shared with warnings against exercising outside. And even that paper didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t go as far as calling runners \u201a\u00c4\u00fasuper-spreaders\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ee which, as Guardian reporter Julia Carrie Wong noted on Twitter, is an incredibly loaded term for businesses that aren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t accused of spreading anything.\n\nAmid a lot of bad-faith attacks on media during the pandemic\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s first several weeks, there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a fair critique that news outlets have promoted research and recommendations far too authoritatively, instead of reflecting the incredible confusion among experts. Meanwhile, Silicon Valley critics have cautioned against overemphasizing high-tech solutions to the disease \u201a\u00c4\u00ee including the Times itself, which warned that putting too much stock in tracking data might simply \u201a\u00c4\u00faprovide an opening for technologists to oversell what they do.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nOverselling is exactly the problem here. This kind of location data could provide some limited guidance for businesses. But if, as the Times\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s headline puts it, you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re curious if it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s safer to visit a coffee shop or a gym? These clean charts don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t hold the answer."

                        "article_content": "The United States has asked Israel to sever ties with China in areas which entail security risks, the Jerusalem Post reports.\n\nCiting an unnamed US official, the Israeli daily revealed that the Trump administration has asked Israel to take concrete steps to reduce its ties with China.\n\nSo far, \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe Israeli side has politely acknowledged our concerns without committing to action,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the unnamed official said.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think polite deflection will cut it anymore,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the official said, adding \"this is a high priority for the US.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nOne industry that the US has pinpointed as particularly sensitive is technology, so much so that the US has been eyeing Chinese-Israeli joint academic research in the field, the report said.\n\nThe US is especially concerned with the billions of dollars Chinese companies have invested in technologies that Israel has classified as commercial, but could be used by Chinese intelligence, like artificial intelligence, satellite communications and cybersecurity.\n\nThe demand came just days after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited the occupied territories and asked Israel to reconsider its joint projects with China in areas with security risks and sensitivities for the US, including academic projects and technological research and development.\n\nIn previous public statements, US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman and other State Department officials had focused on the establishment of a more robust review process for foreign investments that could pose risks, and a reduction of reliance on China for emergency equipment in light of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe US and Israel share some of the most sensitive intelligence with one another. In addition, American contractors sell Israel some of the most classified military hardware and weapons in the US like the F-35 fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, according to the Israeli daily.\n\nThe US is concerned that with China building most of Israel\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s infrastructure \u201a\u00c4\u00ec roads, trains, tunnels, ports and more \u201a\u00c4\u00ec it will eventually gain access to the lines of communication through which Israel and the US communicate intelligence with one another. That is something that Washington will not tolerate, said the report.\n\nFor too long, Israel has cozied up to China while ignoring potential ramifications or fallout with its greatest ally, the United States, the newspaper said.\n\nHowever, Tel Aviv could be on a collision course with Washington unless tight restrictions are imposed on Chinese investment in Israel, because the US president sees this both as a geopolitical security threat and a distraction from accomplishing the objectives of his trade war with China.\n\nAccording to Israel's Army Radio on Tuesday, Tel Aviv has asked Washington for compensation in exchange for reducing ties with China - an offer that the US reportedly rejected.\n\nThe ongoing friction between the US and China has escalated in recent months in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, and the US has put pressure on many of its allies as a result.\n\nThe US has accused China of hiding news of the original outbreak of the novel coronavirus from the world.\n\nPresident Trump has long called COVID-19 a \u201a\u00c4\u00faChinese virus,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 going so far as to accuse Chinese President Xi Jinping of standing behind a \u201a\u00c4\u00fadisinformation and propaganda attack on the United States and Europe.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe current venomous rhetoric by Trump and his allies about China\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faculpability\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 for the COVID-19 pandemic has led to strong reactions from Chinese officials.\n\nChina's Ambassador to Israel Du Wei, who was found dead in his official residence in Herzliya last Sunday, had made a high-profile defense of his country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn an interview with Israel's Makor Rishon newspaper in April, Du addressed the matter of Chinese investments in Israel, expressing hope for further cooperation.\n\nHe also expressed hope to strengthen the ties between Israel and China, addressing the accusations leveled at his country as being the one responsible for the outbreak of the virus.\n\nMystery and speculation surrounds the death and comments from readers under an online article in the Jerusalem Post included: \u201a\u00c4\u00faSomething smells fishy here.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nAnother said there was \u201a\u00c4\u00faa long list of suspects,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and the envoy\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s death was like something in a spy movie, or the US murder investigation show CSI (Crime Scene Investigation).\n\nOthers suggested a link to Pompeo\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s recent whirlwind visit to Israel, during which he was overtly critical of China, and demanded that Israel stop sharing confidential military information with Beijing."

                        "article_content": "COVID-19\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s hidden victims, Alzheimer's patients in nursing homes Nearly 50% of all nursing home residents live with Alzheimer's or dementia.\n\nWhen Ken Gregersen, 88, left his wife's nursing home in Ankeny, Iowa, on March 11, he didn't know that that would be the last time he'd see her for two months.\n\n\"I got an email, or I got notified by the care facility that no longer could I visit her. So I haven't actually seen her then since March,\" he told ABC News.\n\nEvie, his wife of 67 years, is in the late stages of Alzheimer's disease and receives hospice care. Just like thousands across the country, her nursing home closed its doors to visitors amid the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nHoward Smith visits his wife, Lois, a 77-year-old Alzheimer's patient, at the New Paltz Center nursing facility for the first time since lockdowns due to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Pine Bush, NY., May 5, 2020. Caitlin Ochs/Reuters\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has rocked long-term care facilities. State data analyzed by ABC News reveals that almost a third of coronavirus deaths come from nursing homes.\n\nWith nearly half of all long-term care facility residents living with Alzheimer's or dementia, individuals with the disease have become one of the most disproportionately impacted groups from COVID-19 in the country.\n\nAs coronavirus-related deaths continue to climb, some observers have raised alarms that not enough is being done to protect Alzheimer's and dementia patients and those in long-term care facilities.\n\n\"Given some of the numbers that have now emerged, it's pretty clear that we did not have and probably still today don't have what would be full transparency on an accurate and timely basis about where the cases are occurring,\" Alzheimer's Association CEO Harry Johns told ABC News.\n\nAlzheimer's, a chronic neurodegenerative disease, itself, does not make someone more vulnerable to coronavirus. However, those with the illness are more susceptible because they are usually older and/or have co-morbidities. Living in nursing homes also heightens the COVID-19 exposure risk for Alzheimer's and dementia patients.\n\nStill, health concerns are not the only extra burden these individuals carry amid the outbreak. The enforced separation of nursing home residents from their families and loved ones may only increase the hardship.\n\nIn this June 4, 2017, file photo, President and CEO of Alzheimer's Association, Harry Johns, attends the Nashville Disco Party Benefiting Alzheimer's Association in Nashville. Rick Diamond/Getty Images for Alzheimer's Association, FILE\n\n\"Depending on the degree of progression of the disease, someone with Alzheimer's may not understand what's going on,\" Johns said.\n\n\"[They] may not understand then why they can't leave the house. Why the kids are at home and extended family. Those kinds of confusions can, in and of themselves create challenges for the individual who has dementia, as well as for those carers,\" he added.\n\nJohns says he believes current public health circumstances impact those with Alzheimer's more than other care home residents.\n\n\"For any resident that family contact is so important if someone is ill. But for Alzheimer's, people who have dementia, it is especially difficult because the connections to family can -- when someone has progressed -- keep them grounded,\" Johns told ABC News.\n\nCoronavirus has also forced families of individuals living with Alzheimer's and dementia to navigate not seeing their loved ones for extended periods of time.\n\n\"It's not enjoyable at all. I don't know the right emotional words to say. I really do miss her. We're a very close couple, we've been married this long. We've had a wonderful marriage,\" Ken Gregersen said.\n\nKen and Evie Gregersen of Ankeny, Iowa have been married for 67 years. Courtesy of Ken Gregersen\n\nKen's wife, Evie, moved to her nursing home in 2016 after her Alzheimer's diagnosis in 2012. Before the coronavirus outbreak, he would visit his wife three times a day.\n\n\"I would go over there and give her her breakfast. And then I'd go back and give her her lunch, and then I also (went) back to give her her dinner in the evening. And that's when I usually stayed a few minutes extra and I'd walk her around in her wheelchair and sing a song to her. And so I could then go from being her caregiver to being her husband again,\" he said.\n\nWhile Evie's nursing home ended visits, Ken still talks to his wife every weekday on FaceTime. He said as Evie's condition deteriorates -- she can no longer open her eyes or speak -- he worries about many unknowns.\n\nEvie Gregersen was first diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2012. She moved to a nursing home in 2016. Ken Olson Photography\n\n\"Every day, when I see her FaceTime, and I talk to her and I try to tell her, what's going on in my life, or what are our children or grandchildren are doing, I always wonder does she hear me? Does she understand me? Does she miss me? You know, it makes me very anxious,\" he added.\n\nAlthough Evie's nursing home has reported no patients or caregivers testing positive for coronavirus, Ken still worries what could happen if his wife contracts the virus.\n\n\"I know that I'm going to lose her someday. I mean I'm prepared for that. I think people who are taking care of someone with Alzheimer's, they start through the grieving process long before death occurs,\" he said.\n\n\"I know it's going to occur, but I don't want her to suffer. And the COVID virus ... it looks like there's a lot of suffering going on, you know, gasping for air and being so uncomfortable. That worries me,\" he added.\n\nBefore the coronavirus outbreak, Ken Gregersen would visit his wife three times a day at her nursing home. Courtesy of Ken Gregersen\n\nKen says he's satisfied with the precautions Evie's nursing home has taken. However, as coronavirus cases rise in long-term care facilities, there have been calls for states and the federal government to do more to protect care facilities.\n\nThis week, the Alzheimer's Association announced new policy recommendations to fight coronavirus in long-term care facilities.\n\nJohns identifies increased transparency, testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) as critical in fighting the disease at nursing homes, and helping to get to a point where family members can visit their loved ones.\n\n\"We believe it takes these multiple approaches. That PPE will make a difference, but if you don't have the testing, then you can't prevent the outbreaks. If you don't have the transparency, you can't deal rapidly enough with the outbreaks. So, it is the dynamic combination of doing these things that we believe is most crucial,\" Johns said.\n\n\"It is the dynamic of all of these things happening to improve people's lives, save people's lives and really, relieve the burden that is so present for people who care for those with Alzheimer's and other dementia,\" he added.\n\nOn Monday, President Donald Trump's administration also called for increased coronavirus testing with Vice President Mike Pence telling governors he wants to see every state prioritize COVID-19 screening inside the facilities.\n\nHowever, those guidelines do not go as far as those of the Alzheimer's Association.\n\nBut until those guidelines are met, people continue to wait to visit their loved ones living in long-term care facilities. Meanwhile, family members, like Gregersen, settle for seeing their parents, spouses and friends' faces confined to portable screens.\n\n\"Thank goodness the hospice caregivers who come in set up a FaceTime event Monday to Friday so that I get a chance to see [Evie's] face. She no longer opens her eyes, but I'd like to think that she hears my voice. And I'd like to think she recognizes it,\" Gregerson said.\n\nWhat to know about coronavirus:\n\nHow it started and how to protect yourself: Coronavirus explained\n\nWhat to do if you have symptoms: Coronavirus symptoms\n\nTracking the spread in the U.S. and worldwide: Coronavirus map"

He has accused the country of not reporting accurate numbers and of censoring research regarding the coronavirus.\n\n\"The Chinese Communist Party tried to suppress information about this virus, about where it began, about how it started, about how it was being transmitted from human to human, indeed employed the World Health Organization to further that storyline,\" Pompeo told Christian radio program Focus on the Family, earlier this week, Newsweek reported.\n\nThe news comes as tensions between the US and China appear to be escalating. While Trump initially praised President Xi Jinping's response to the outbreak in January, the president and his administration have since blamed it for deliberately starting the virus.\n\nTrump added to White House speculation in April when he said that he had evidence showing that the coronavirus originated from a lab in Wuhan, China, but that he would not reveal what it is.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump suggested that China's handling of the novel coronavirus is proof that Beijing \"will do anything they can\" to ensure he isn't reelected in November.\n\nAt the time of writing, the US has seen more than 1.4 million confirmed cases and 88,507 deaths, according to Worldometer."

                        "article_content": "Article courtesy of: Carol Petersen, RPh, CNP\n\nViruses have been with us since the dawn of man. An estimated 380 trillion viruses can infect the human body at any one time. (1) Human biology is exquisitely tuned to defeat viruses or to coexist with viruses as part of the human viome. Our relationship with microbes is vibrant and sometimes a fight for one-upmanship. (2) Our existence is a testament to our ability to manage viral loads.\n\nThe pharmacopeias of the world, of some 500,000 different drugs, contain long lists of substances which have antiviral, antibiotic and immune boosting substances. This list alone of antiviral drugs (3) is impressive. It is almost certain that within the realm of the worldwide knowledge of substances, that some would exist which would counter the threat of the coronavirus and any other virus that overwhelms us.\n\nGiven the threat of global viral pandemics, how can the whole of the world\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s medical and scientific communities not be mobilized and galvanized? Is it beyond the world\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s governments to open the door of their various warehouses to find an antidote to the coronavirus which is now strongly suspected to have been developed as a bioweapon? If this is the case, it is almost a certainty that there are multiple antiviral agents already at hand to control this plague.\n\nBut, for a moment, let\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s assume the opposite. That this coronavirus is a previously unseen natural biological agent created by Mother Nature on her worst day. The sum of the world\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s scientific and academic brain power should still have the means to undo this clever virus.\n\nA virus is a little thing with very few operating parts and no immune system of its own and no ability to reproduce on its own. The entire animal world including humans cannot have existed thus far without the knowledge and the means to overcome not only the coronavirus, but all virus pathogens whether bioengineered or not, collectively, can and do the governments of the world deliberately keep information from us? Some reporters are noting that the top virologists and microbiologists in the world are mysteriously dying or disappearing, to the toll of over 100 and counting. (4)(5) Why?\n\nThese are urgent times. The reality is that we have the ability, mindpower, and manpower. What we don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have is the approbation of the powers that be. Doctors are not allowed to be doctors. Scientists are handcuffed into belief systems that must have authority approval. The coronavirus pandemic has been projected to kill as many as 65 million people (6). If projections hold true, this is a time that requires great courage to step out and tap into our incredible human resources. Some world leaders have called for a population reduction by at least 15% and some as high as 90%. (7)\n\nThose who have become physicians must step up and act as the healers and leaders that they intended to be. We are now in a situation that demands a higher calling. Step up and do what you know to be right for yourself and humanity, there may not be a next chance if you do not.\n\nFollowing is a short list of available therapies which can have a positive impact on quelling a pandemic. Some therapies should be used right away to make sure that your immune system is in order. Some should be used at the first sign of illness for speedy recovery. Finally, some will be offered for cytokine storms. The immune system overreacts to the infection, and the resulting inflammation overwhelms the body. Cytokine storms can lead to sepsis (infection carried in the blood stream leading to organ collapse) which is often fatal. However, there have been successful interventions for sepsis and the preceding pneumonia.\n\nThere are well documented and proven interventions that have been reported in clinical literature again and again over the past 100 years - you must not ignore the solutions on hand while waiting for officially approved new proprietary drugs while people are dying.\n\nIonic Solutions and Colloids of Silver and Copper\n\nBefore antibiotics, silver was the antibiotic of choice. Silver solutions can be prepared to drink on a regular basis as preventative or used to treat. Silver solutions can be used in neti pots for the nose or simply used as a nasal spray. In extreme cases, silver has been used as an intravenous treatment. (8). Copper solutions can be used to disinfect surfaces.(9)\n\nOzone\n\nOzone is a gas which quickly converts into oxygen which can treat any infection. It can be added to water to drink, used to clean produce and surfaces. It can be used in therapy in the ears, vaginally and rectally. It is too irritating to the lungs to inhale unless bubbled through an oil first. Ozonated oils can be used on the skin. The American Association of Ozone Therapy (AOT) website provides information and a physician referral. A trained practitioner is needed for ozone to be used intravenously. (10) Dr. Robert Rowen teaches ozone therapies to train practitioners. He traveled to Sri Lanka to treat Ebola with ozone injected directly. (11) Before being impeded by an authoritative government, he was able to demonstrate recovery from Ebola with ozone. He pioneered doing an intravenous therapy using 10 passes of ozone. This can be used for the most resistant of infections.\n\nOxygen/Hyperbaric Oxygen/Hydrogen peroxide\n\nOxygen can be delivered in other forms to deal with infections. At the first sign of respiratory distress in hospitals, patients are given oxygen to breathe. Home units of oxygen concentrators can be used to improve oxygenation. Hyperbaric chambers supply extra oxygen to the whole body at pressure. Tissue oxygenation happens while bypassing the lungs. When hydrogen peroxide bubbles, water and oxygen are released yielding its disinfectant qualities. Hydrogen peroxide can clean surfaces, and it can be used in the ears and gargled diluted in water at the first sign of a cold or flu. Hydrogen peroxide is also used medically intravenously and provides increased oxygen levels for the body.\n\nHydrochloric Acid, Hydrogen\n\nThere is a book documenting the incredible effects of hydrochloric acid (HCl). \u201a\u00c4\u00faThree Years of Hydrochloric Acid Therapy\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 which can be viewed by clicking here. Hydrochloric acid is used both intramuscularly and intravenously and provides an immune system boost. Molecular hydrogen ions or hydrogen gas can be used therapeutically to quell oxidative stress. The science behind hydrogen is compiled at the Molecular Hydrogen Institute. (12)\n\nIntravenous and Oral Vitamin C\n\nVitamin C is available to use orally and has been ever since Dr. Linus Pauling demonstrated its antiviral effects. To use orally, instructions are to use vitamin C in frequent dosing to the point of getting diarrhea and then backing down but not stopping and continuing till resolved. Vitamin C can be taken daily for maintenance. Dr. Pauling himself used about 30 gm of vitamin C daily. (13) 60 Minutes aired a segment on the miraculous recovery of a New Zealand man who was given intravenous vitamin C and recovered quickly from a viral infection after doctors had recommended that the family stop all life support, and death would ensue in 1-2 days. Normally, you would think that this would shake the medical communities of the world to action to provide intravenous vitamin C for all critical infections. Intravenous vitamin C is a mainstay in functional medicine but is not to be found in our hospitals. Search out providers ahead of time in case this modality is needed.(14) Dr. Fred Klenner used both intramuscular vitamin C and intravenous vitamin C for numerous viral infections including polio successfully. However, his groundbreaking work was ignored in favor of the promotion of a vaccine program. (15)\n\nUltraviolet Blood Irradiation or Photo Luminescence\n\nExposing the blood to the ultraviolet spectrum of light was developed in the 1920\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s and also suffered a fate like Dr. Fred Klenner\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s treatments for virus infections. This time it was the advent of penicillin that became the favored treatment. In this approach only a small amount of blood is removed and exposed to light in the ultraviolet range, then the blood is returned to the body. Then there is a profound increase in oxygen, and blood immune components are improved dramatically. This treatment can be used to quell the dangerous cytokine storms and rescue patients from sepsis. The equipment and supplies are very inexpensive and treatment time is just minutes. There are practitioners who still use this therapy in their practices.(16) (17)\n\nThis article highlights some of the opportunities that can and should be implemented in managing a pandemic. Effective treatments have already been developed and abandoned, sometimes for less effective treatments. Some of these are do it yourself solutions, and most need the intervention of a skilled practitioner. Be prepared by learning where and how these therapies can be readily accessed. There is much more in that warehouse of human ingenuity. Remember the most vulnerable are the young, old, and those with existing conditions. This discussion will be continued."

J.B. Pritzker again defended the decision to go forward with the election, saying he had no legal authority under the Illinois Constitution to do otherwise.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faSo, I couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t shut it down,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Pritzker said, noting he had instead encouraged voters to vote early and vote by mail.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe were encouraging people not to go to the polls if they could avoid going to the polls, and indeed I think that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s exactly the same, that we need to do even more so when we get to the general election,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the governor said.\n\nHe also pointed out the election was held four days before he issued a stay-at-home order, making Illinois the second state in the nation to take that extreme step.\n\nPritzker\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s administration announced Monday that an additional 1,173 cases of COVID-19 have been identified in Illinois along with 74 more deaths. That brings the statewide total to 22,025 cases and 794 deaths.\n\nJim Allen, spokesman for the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners, said the board is sending letters to all voters and other election workers who may have come in contact with Burke at the polling place to inform them they may have been exposed.\n\nAllen said it is the fourth letter sent from the board in the aftermath of the election warning of specific instances of possible COVID exposure because of a known confirmed case of someone who either worked or voted at a polling place.\n\nThe other letters involved the following polling places: Andrew Jackson Language Academy, 1340 W. Harrison, in the 28th Ward; Montclare Senior Residences, 1200 E. 78th St. in the 8th Ward; and William Dever School, 3436 N. Osceola, which hosted precincts from both the 29th and 38th Wards.\n\nMatt Dietrich, a spokesman for the State Board of Elections, said this is the first report in Illinois of an election worker dying from the coronavirus.\n\nAccording to the Cook County Medical Examiner\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s report of COVID-19 victims, Burke suffered from diabetes and hypertensive arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease.\n\nAld. David Moore (17th) said Burke\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s family had asked him to not discuss his death.\n\nPreviously, the alderman posted photos of Burke on his Facebook page and described him as a \u201a\u00c4\u00facommitted\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 17th Ward precinct captain and 15-year city employee.\n\nThe alderman noted Burke wrote on his own Facebook introduction: \u201a\u00c4\u00faLife is too short stay Happy. I love being with family and friends. Bowling, shooting pool, road trip.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9"

                        "article_content": "Not every child is born with skills to solve math equations and divide and multiply swiftly. Most of them struggle with calculations, algebra, and graphs. And the approach most parents take in pushing them toward the ability is through destructive and degrading feedback. Yes, math is an essential part of the world, and without this basic skill, no person can succeed in life. But there are better ways of infusing this mindset in children than by force.\n\nAdministering the latest situation of complete or partial lockdown in all coronavirus infected countries, with no sign of educational institutes reopening, you as a parent may be more than ever worried about the math education of your children. Teachers and school administrations are doing their best with video lectures, but the engagement and productive factors are lessened.\n\nIn a time like this, the best thing you can do is take it upon yourself to give your child the math education they truly need. This can be done by showing them real-life examples of math problems. Most kids aren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t good at math because they don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t understand how it works and aren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t able to apply it in everyday life.\n\nIn addition to including real-life problems, you can make use of the internet by downloading highly interactive math puzzles, math educating games and apps, fun math videos, and more. Take out the board games that have been eating dust in your attic to play with your kids, as several of them are related to math problem-solving. Or make games by yourself using cutout numbers and math symbols for kids to learn and have fun."

                        "article_content": "You'll only get the best stuff we have!\n\nGet the best Trump news straight to your inbox!\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci appeared for interviews Friday and dropped a grenade into the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s reopening conversation.\n\nStay-at-home orders intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus could end up causing \u201a\u00c4\u00fairreparable damage\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 if imposed for too long, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNBC on Friday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want people to think that any of us feel that staying locked down for a prolonged period of time is the way to go,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Fauci said during an interview with CNBC\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Meg Tirrell on \u201a\u00c4\u00faHalftime Report.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nIndeed. The country has only been discussing this very topic for weeks now, as between 38.6 and 43 million Americans have been thrown into unemployment thanks directly to the coronavirus shutdown.\n\nThe discussion has not included Dr. Fauci, and he appears to have been sidelined from making public comments by the White House in recent days. During those same days, President Trump has increasingly called for states to lift restrictions and let the reopening begin.\n\nDuring the same interview, Dr. Fauci poured some cold water on reopenings that are underway, but in that passive-aggressive way of doing so without being specific.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIn general, I think most of the country is doing it in a prudent way,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThere are obviously some situations where people might be jumping over that. I just say please proceed with caution if you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to do that.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nNot helpful. Who is jumping ahead? Florida \u201a\u00c4\u00ee which has not seen a spike despite dire media predictions that it would? Texas \u201a\u00c4\u00ee which is crab-walking toward reopening while about 46% of its coronavirus deaths statewide have been in nursing homes? Or is California taking entirely too long? How about Michigan and the whimsical Gov. Whitmer?\n\nPeople need to work. The economy crashes and a whole lot more people will die the longer the shutdowns drag on.\n\nWhile some in the capital cocktail set see Dr. Fauci as a sex symbol, he has been a panic peddler during much of this crisis.\n\nFor instance, May 13, 2020: As states reopened, Dr. Fauci warned of \u201a\u00c4\u00faneedless suffering and death\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 if states move too fast.\n\nUnemployment was already well over 20 million by then, or roughly the whole population of the state of New York. A million of those newly unemployed are healthcare workers. Hospitals and medical practices have been creaking and threatening to collapse since early April.\n\nSince then, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve blown past that unemployment number, past Florida, past Texas, to leave the equivalent of the entire population of California unemployed.\n\nPlus or minus a million or two.\n\nHow, in what universe, can unemployment on this scale not cause \u201a\u00c4\u00fairreparable damage?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nEspecially when an estimated 42% of these unemployed and their jobs are never ever ever getting back together?\n\nOur energy sector went from powering everything to being vulnerable to foreign takeover in a flash.\n\nWhole national job-creating companies have filed for bankruptcy or laid thousands of their workers off.\n\nAnd the federal government is writing hot checks in the trillions every few weeks.\n\nThis is by definition \u201a\u00c4\u00fairreparable damage,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Dr. F.\n\nI haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t been too critical of Fauci up to this point. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s an epidemiologist trying to prevent mass death from a virus. His job is not to worry about the economics.\n\nBut it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s looking increasingly like we need a second opinion, from another doctor who also has run a practice and therefore understands economics. As Sen. Rand Paul, who is a doctor, noted in Senate testimony in mid-May, Dr. Fauci isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t the \u201a\u00c4\u00fabe all end all\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of this crisis. Dr. Fauci actually agreed. And he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not.\n\nThe economic dimension of this crisis has long stayed in the back seat while the healthcare dimension took the wheel. That was reasonable in the beginning. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a pandemic, which is a medical crisis first and foremost.\n\nThey both need some time in the driver\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s seat. We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve flattened the curve. There\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s no evidence at this point (it could change!) that reopening is causing serious spikes in new infections. We still haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t come to grips with the facts on nursing home and assisted living facitlity-related coronavirus deaths nationwide. That discussion has not happened in any serious way.\n\nNeither has the necessary discussion about suicides related to economic misery.\n\nWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re past time for all that.\n\nVia PJMedia"

The country, an epicenter of the pandemic, plans to be mostly reopened within the next few weeks, with strict health guidelines.\n\nThe Italian government plans to allow travel to and from the country beginning June 3, according to a new decree signed Saturday by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. Citizens will also be able to travel freely within the country starting that same day.\n\nCertain travel may still be limited based on disease risks, which will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. People who have tested positive for COVID-19 will still remain under strict quarantine orders.\n\nThe travel ban lifts the day after Italy's Republic Day, likely preventing mass travel over a long holiday weekend.\n\nItaly's infection rate has fallen sharply in recent days. Despite calls for a quicker reopening, Conte said a gradual return to normalcy can help prevent a second wave of infections, Reuters reports.\n\nSome shops in Italy start to reopen amid pandemic\n\nAccording to the decree, all sectors of the economy still shuttered can reopen in June, as long as proper safety guidelines, social distancing and hygiene rules are adhered to. Health officials plan to closely monitor reopening in order to limit further infections.\n\nThe country maintained strict lockdown guidelines until May 4, when it allowed factories and parks to reopen. Shops plan to open May 18, and that same day, people will be able to move freely within their region.\n\nBefore coronavirus truly took hold in the United States, Italy had the highest number of COVID-19 infections in the world. It was the first European country to impose nationwide lockdown restrictions and has struggled for months to limit the virus' spread.\n\nItaly currently has the fifth-highest number of confirmed infections globally with over 233,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases. It has the third-highest death toll, behind the U.S. and the U.K., with over 31,000 confirmed deaths."

                        "article_content": "The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits in the two months since the coronavirus took hold in the U.S. has swelled to nearly 39 million, the government reported Thursday, even as states from coast to coast gradually reopen their economies and let people go back to work.\n\nMore than 2.4 million people filed for unemployment last week in the latest wave of layoffs from the business shutdowns that have brought the economy to its knees, the Labor Department said.\n\nThat brings the running total to a staggering 38.6 million, a job-market collapse unprecedented in its speed.\n\nThe number of weekly applications has slowed for seven straight weeks. Yet the figures remain breathtakingly high \u201a\u00c4\u00ee 10 times higher than normal before the crisis struck.\n\nIt shows that even though all states have begun reopening over the past three weeks, employment has yet to snap back and the outbreak is still damaging businesses and destroying jobs.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWhile the steady decline in claims is good news, the labor market is still in terrible shape,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said over the weekend that U.S. unemployment could peak in May or June at 20% to 25%, a level last seen during the depths of the Great Depression almost 90 years ago. Unemployment in April stood at 14.7%, a figure also unmatched since the 1930s.\n\nOver 5 million people worldwide have been confirmed infected by the virus, and about 330,000 deaths have been recorded, including about 94,000 in the U.S. and around 165,000 in Europe, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University and based on government data. Experts believe the true toll is significantly higher. \u201a\u00c4\u00ec READ MORE\n\nListen to the insightful Thomas Paine Podcast Below --"

He added:\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faEveryone is entitled to come and go as they want, typically, but in the fairgrounds situation we wanted to make sure that people who are positive stayed in the ill parts of the shelter \u201a\u00c4\u00ee period.\u201a\u00c4\u00f91\n\nJahangir said the vast majority of people who tested positive in Nashville have cooperated with officials, so \u201a\u00c4\u00faformal quarantines\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 have been unnecessary. However, the city has the option of using a legally enforceable quarantine order whenever necessary, and recently had to do so after a COVID-19 patient jumped a fence and fled the Nashville Fairgrounds.\n\nHealth officials informed the man he could not leave until he was cleared, but he jumped a fence and left anyway, according to the arrest affidavit, which was the first of its kind in the city. The man was stopped and arrested by Metro Nashville Parks police by a city cemetery nearly two miles from where he had been quarantined.\n\nThe arrest highlights the difference between citizens advised to remain at home and those ordered into quarantine. The mayor of Nashville has instructed residents to stay home as much as possible. However, those who test positive for coronavirus can be ordered into quarantine, which police can enforce.\n\nRELATED STORY:\n\nIn addition to Nashville, commissioners in Palm Beach County, Florida unanimously approved a plan to shelter the homeless in the old Palm Beach County Detention Center near the South Florida Fairgrounds.\n\nResidents in the area sounded off, expressing frustration at being left out of the conversation. One such resident, Blair English, said:\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are worried about having up to 125 homeless people right down the road from us.\u201a\u00c4\u00f92\n\nRELATED STORY:\n\nCounty leaders say the old detention center is a safe place for the homeless to lay their heads. They\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll have access to job training and medical care. Palm Beach County Mayor Dave Kerner added:\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen folks come to the county commission and say \u201a\u00c4\u00f2I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want this person in my backyard,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 well they are not going to be in your backyard. But they are in other people\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s backyard right now and they are not being well taken care of by the government and that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not acceptable.\u201a\u00c4\u00f92\n\nPalm Beach County leaders made it very clear that people who opt out of using the shelter won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be allowed to continue camping at parks, while advocates for the homeless feel for the plan to work, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to come down to how it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s presented to the people who will use it.\n\nHomeless resident David Thorton Jr., like dozens of others living in tents at John Prince Park, says he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s thrilled to hear about the access to resources to help him get back on his feet, but he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not completely sold on the plan. He said:\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIf it looks like a jail\u201a\u00c4\u00b6 I feel like they are just trying to lock up the homeless because they think that we are lower than scum. I understand that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not meant to be [a] luxurious thing, but if it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s like a jail that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s kind of pointless. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s making us look like we are ex-cons and stuff.\u201a\u00c4\u00f92\n\nSources:\n\nShares"

A State-By-State Guide\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mark Lennihan/AP Mark Lennihan/AP\n\nEvery U.S. state has implemented restrictions designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. Businesses reduced or ceased operations, people transitioned into working and learning remotely, and nonessential activities were paused. At least temporarily, much of the country was under strict orders to stay home.\n\nState officials are now charting paths to a new normal, seeking a balance between reopening economies and protecting public health. Many governors are outlining new frameworks and timelines for their states as they ramp up testing and contact tracing efforts. Some have also formed regional partnerships to coordinate economic recovery. Most are releasing general and industry-specific reopening guidelines for businesses and individuals.\n\nPresident Trump's federal guidelines for social distancing and mitigation expired on May 1. Many states are modifying stay-at-home orders, prolonging school closures or delaying elections until after that date. Many are also lifting certain restrictions as they embark on phased-in recovery plans. And while more than half of states have partially reopened, public health experts say that some are doing so too quickly, as they warn of a second wave of infections. At a May 12 Senate hearing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S.'s top infectious disease expert, expressed concern about some states and localities skipping federal guidelines to open prematurely.\n\nGovernors have created their own data dashboards and task forces to guide their planning, and provide regular progress updates.

                        "article_content": "As more musicians kick off online concerts amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, Bandsintown is launching a new feature to support them. The concert notification service can now push out a \u201a\u00c4\u00fawatch live\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 notification when musicians are live-streaming shows. These notifications will appear on Bandsintown, along with Facebook pages, Instagram Stories, and other places that surface Bandsintown listings.\n\nTwitch is increasingly becoming a popular place for indie musicians to make money amid the pandemic. With touring essentially at a standstill, many are looking to online platforms in order to try and recoup lost funds from shows.\n\nAdditionally, Bandsintown has launched its own Twitch channel, with all proceeds going to the MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund. The first show features South African DJ Black Coffee and will stream at 1PM ET today.\n\nBandsintown says it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s starting the channel both to connect artists with fans while many are stuck at home and to help raise more funds for MusiCares through Twitch. There are a bunch of ways to financially support streamers on Twitch, as longtime Twitch user Ducky told The Verge yesterday. Users can subscribe to channels or tip small amounts, and Amazon Prime members are able to subscribe to one channel per month for free.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faAs true music fans, there are ways you can help us help artists,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 reads Bandsintown\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s announcement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re able to, avoid asking for refunds, buy their merch, attend their live shows when they return, donate to tips jars, or donate to MusiCares.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nMusiCares is an arm of the Recording Academy that provides financial relief to those in the music industry facing unexpected hardships. (Disclosure: I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m the vice president of the Chicago chapter of the Recording Academy.) With many musicians currently unable to tour and out of work, the organization recently launched a separate fund specifically for artists and other industry professionals affected by the pandemic.\n\nBandsintown says its next live stream is scheduled for next week, and it will be a multiday live music marathon featuring both emerging and established artists."

                        "article_content": "\nAmong the many lessons of the coronavirus pandemic is how close humans are to the rest of the animal kingdom. We get diseases from other animals, and then we use more animals to figure out how to stop the diseases. As research ramps up treatments and vaccines, animals are crucial to fighting the pandemic.\nThere are different animals at each end of the pandemic, of course. The new disease almost certainly began with a bat virus, scientists agree. That virus probably passed through another animal, perhaps pangolins, on its way to humans.\nBut the animals that scientists will depend on in the lab are mice, first of all, and then perhaps ferrets or hamsters or monkeys. Around the world, different laboratories are racing to breed stocks of mice genetically engineered for research and testing the susceptibility of other animals to infection with the virus that causes Covid-19.\nThere are, of course, many objections to animal testing, particularly when it comes to primates, but researchers are deeply concerned about the hazards to humans of treatments or vaccines that have not been tried on other animals first.\nNo single kind of animal will serve all test purposes and scientists have several criteria for what makes an animal useful in testing therapies and vaccines for effectiveness.\nFirst, it must be susceptible to infection, and not all animals are. Despite the quarantining of one dog in Hong Kong, with a \u201a\u00c4\u00faweak positive\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 test for coronavirus, various health agencies are not taking a single, ambiguous result as evidence for concern. Advisories state there is no evidence yet that pets are susceptible to the disease.\nAnd even when laboratory animals are susceptible to infection, that doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t mean they get sick. \u201a\u00c4\u00faMost of them, they don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t care at all that they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re infected,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a microbiologist at the University of Iowa who developed a mouse in 2003 that was susceptible to infection with the SARS virus. It is called the hACE2 mouse.\nIf an animal doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t get sick from the infection, its use is limited, because testing treatment effectiveness requires observing whether the treatment stops the symptoms.\nThe best laboratory animal would not only get infected and get sick, but get sick in the same way that humans do, showing a similar course of disease. Then a test would give the most information.\nDr. Perlman pointed out that the hACE2 strain of mice susceptible to SARS got sick, \u201a\u00c4\u00fabut developed a brain disease\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in addition to other symptoms. A new study from China, not yet peer-reviewed, suggests that these mice do get infected with the new pandemic virus, which is called SARS-CoV-2, and develop mild pneumonia. The paper made no mention of the virus affecting the brain.\nThis strain of mice will be used in some of the first laboratory experiments. But first it is necessary to breed them. Like many other genetically engineered mice varieties, scientists don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t keep live colonies on hand. Instead the mice\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s frozen sperm and embryos are kept ready.\nThe hACE2 mice were put on ice when the SARS outbreak stopped in the early 2000s. Chien-Te Tseng at the University of Texas Medical Branch, who independently developed an hACE2 mouse, is now building up a colony from frozen embryos in his lab. Mice have a three-week gestation period, or pregnancy, and take eight weeks to reach sexual maturity.\nDr. Perlman is not rejuvenating the strain himself. He sent 16 vials of frozen sperm to the Jackson Laboratory in Maine, one of the biggest breeders of laboratory animals, so they can ramp up their production.\nThey hope to have mice ready for distribution, at cost, by May, according to Cat Lutz, director of the mouse repository, with responsibility for thousands of strains of mice, including the hACE2.\nThe advantage of this strain is that it has a human receptor on its cells called an ACE2 receptor, thus its name. That allows it to be infected with SARS and the new coronavirus, which both target that receptor as they try to invade cells.\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThere\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a huge demand,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Dr. Lutz said, \u201a\u00c4\u00fanot only in the United States, but globally.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Dr. Lutz said that researchers at the Jackson Laboratory will also be investigating other ways to make mice more susceptible to the new coronavirus.\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThere\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s never only one mouse model that we use.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 For diabetes she said, \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe have eight different models that we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll look at depending on the answer that we want to ask. And I think the same is going to be true in this circumstance as well.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\nDr. Michael Diamond, in infectious disease specialist at Washington University in St. Louis, is also planning to do research with the hACE2 mouse, and other strains.\nHe said that although mice take time to breed, creating a supply of them is still quicker than using larger animals. Mice, he said, may help scientists \u201a\u00c4\u00fato sort of winnow down some of the candidates\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 for vaccines.\nDr. Diamond also said that groups around the globe are pursuing many of the same goals. At first it might seem redundant, but because there are so many unanticipated problems that arise in vaccine and treatment tests, redundancy is a feature of the scientific process rather than a drawback.\nInevitably, he said, vaccine and treatment researchers will move to other animals, perhaps hamsters and ferrets, but certainly monkeys, which are most likely to replicate how the disease progresses in humans. All work with the live virus takes place in level 3 biosecure labs, Dr. Diamond said.\nDave O\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Connor, a pathologist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, is working with colleagues to test the usefulness of monkeys in the study of coronavirus treatments. He said that a Chinese group had already published some data on rhesus macaques and he had heard that more results from other labs around the world would be coming soon.\nThose results would be on the suitability of primates for laboratory tests, not on immediate cures. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is not the movie \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Contagion\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 where there will be a magic discovery in a monkey that allows everyone to recover immediately,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said.\nHe added that, \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are potentially going to be dealing with this for a really long time and need to come to better terms with that.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9"

Here is the latest as of Thursday, May 21.\n\nHealth officials have been cautioning all along that the number of confirmed cases, and the list of locations, don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t show the disease\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s true prevalence. Researchers working in L.A. County found in April that the number of people who have actually contracted COVID-19 was probably 28 to 55 times higher than the number of confirmed cases.\n\nAs of Thursday, 42,138 people have tested positive for COVID-19 since the outbreak began, up 3% (1,163 cases) from the day before and 19% from a week before. That is based on the latest reports from L.A. County and the cities of Long Beach and Pasadena, which have their own health departments and are typically at least a day ahead of the county in reporting their cities\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 numbers.\n\nAnother 45 deaths were announced Thursday, bringing the county\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s toll to 2,021.\n\nSo far, about 403,000 people have been tested for the coronavirus in L.A. County. That represents 3.96% of the county\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s population.\n\nCounty officials are releasing some additional information that does not include the cases in Long Beach and Pasadena.\n\nHospitalizations:\n\nAn average of 1,532 people per day have been hospitalized over the past three days.\n\n6,026 patients have been hospitalized since the outbreak began. That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 60 new hospitalizations reported since the day before.\n\nCases by age range:\n\n0 to 17: 1,601 cases (4%)\n\n1,601 cases (4%) 18 to 40: 14,063 cases (35%)\n\n14,063 cases (35%) 41 to 65: 16,040 cases (40%)\n\n16,040 cases (40%) Over 65: 7,991 cases (20%)\n\n7,991 cases (20%) Under investigation: 158 cases (0.4%)\n\nCases by gender:\n\nMale: 50% of cases\n\n50% of cases Female: 49% of cases\n\n49% of cases Other: 0.02% of cases\n\n0.02% of cases Under investigation: 0.8% of cases\n\nCases by race and ethnicity:\n\nHispanic/Latino: 36% of cases, 39% of deaths\n\n36% of cases, 39% of deaths White: 13% of cases, 29% of deaths\n\n13% of cases, 29% of deaths Asian: 7% of cases, 17% of deaths\n\n7% of cases, 17% of deaths Black: 4% of cases, 12% of deaths\n\n4% of cases, 12% of deaths Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander: 0.7% of cases, 0.8% of deaths\n\n0.7% of cases, 0.8% of deaths American Indian/Alaska Native: 0.1% of cases, 0.1% of deaths\n\n0.1% of cases, 0.1% of deaths Other: 4% of cases, 1.1% of deaths\n\n4% of cases, 1.1% of deaths Under investigation: 35% of cases, 0.6% of deaths\n\nUse the chart below to explore what locations have the most or fewest confirmed cases and deaths, as well as the highest and lowest rate of cases and deaths relative to their population.

                        "article_content": "Comments by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nThere has been a debate going on in healthcare for more than 100 years. It started in the 1800s when two competing points of view were put forward to explain disease, and the cause of disease.\n\nFrench medical scientist Louis Pasteur wrote on the \u201a\u00c4\u00fagerm theory\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of disease, while his French contemporary, Antoine B\u221a\u00a9champ promoted a theory of \u201a\u00c4\u00faterrain,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 or sometimes referred to as the \u201a\u00c4\u00facellular theory.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe following chart highlights some of the differences between the two theories:\n\nAn objective, critical review of each theory can find some merit to each approach.\n\nFor example, Pasteur\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s work on unseen germs led to a change in practice for surgeons of the day, and many credit the work of Scottish doctor Joseph Lister for starting the practice of requiring surgeons to wash and disinfect their hands prior to surgery. Hospital-induced infections such as sepsis dropped so dramatically, that the practice of sterilization spread to surgical equipment as well.\n\nBut as an overall model for disease and health, many feel that Pasteur\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s germ theory of disease overstates things in a reductionist sort of way that misses much in disease treatment. Holistic doctors today who supplement their medical training based mostly on the germ theory of disease, tend to follow the work originally put forth by B\u221a\u00a9champ that the \u201a\u00c4\u00faterrian,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 more commonly referred to today as the body\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faimmune system,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 is much more important and effective in treating or curing disease.\n\nThe evidence to support this theory is that pathogens affect everyone differently, not the same. Even during some of the most deadly recorded \u201a\u00c4\u00faplagues\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 or \u201a\u00c4\u00fapandemics\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in history, some people succumbed, while others did not. Usually those who survived far outnumber those who died, leading to the theory that the immune system is the key factor in not only fighting disease, but preventing it in the first place.\n\nOf course today\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s medical system is NOT focused on prevention by building up the body\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s immune system, as there is no profit from that. Today\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s multi-TRILLION dollar medical industry needs sick patients to treat to remain economically viable. Well patients don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t provide the same profit. See:\n\nBut just as Dr. Joseph Lister put into practice Pastuer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s theory of germs with great success in reducing hospital deaths, which might be great for preventing the deaths of patients already sick and is more of a \u201a\u00c4\u00fahygiene\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 protocol than a health protocol, so too many physicians today are putting into practice methods that more closely follow B\u221a\u00a9champ\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s theories by bolstering the body\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s immune system with great success in treating disease.\n\nOne such doctor that we have featured many times here on Health Impact News, is Dr. David Brownstein from the Center For Holistic Medicine in Michigan.\n\nDr. Brownstein has just published a report where he is claiming that his clinic has treated 85 patients for COVID-19 and that none of them have died, and none of them had to be hospitalized. He has also video recorded some of their testimonies.\n\nSo what treatment protocols did Dr. Brownstein use for this kind of success rate?\n\n85 COVID Patients at The Center for Holistic Medicine: Zero Hospitalizations and No Deaths\n\nby Dr. Brownstein\n\nAt my office, the Center for Holistic Medicine (CHM), we have had 85 COVID patients. At this time, no one has been hospitalized, no one has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and there have been no deaths.\n\nThere are five practitioners at CHM: Drs. Brownstein, Ng, Nusbaum, Jenny Drummond, PA, and Taylor Easson, NP. Since the start of the COVID-19 crisis, I have been asking my partners how their COVID patients are doing.\n\nAs of this week, we have had 85 patients either diagnosed with COVID or suspected COVID. I am pleased to report that our patients are doing well with this illness. (Note, since new guidelines have come out stating that any suspected COVID patient can be diagnosed with COVID, I am lumping COVID and suspected COIVD patients together for this post.)\n\nI first reported to you about COVID on January 26, 2020. That was the first time I presented our protocol of using vitamins A, C, D, and iodine not only to support the immune system but also to treat viral infections.\n\nIn that post, I also pointed out how important eating a healthy diet is. The importance of using intravenous nutrient therapy, especially vitamin C, was mentioned.\n\nFinally, I suggested that, with coronavirus, it would be wise not to get a flu vaccine since the flu vaccine has been shown to significantly increase the risk of coronavirus and other flu-like viral infections.\n\nThat post seems like a lifetime ago even though it was only 10 weeks ago. During that time period, my message has not changed. In fact, after witnessing the results our patients have experienced, I am more convinced than ever that a holistic approach like I presented above should be the first-line treatment provided to any COVID patient.\n\nThe human body is a true wonder. Given the proper support, it can do wonders. And, when the body is healthy, it can withstand and overcome an infectious illness like COVID.\n\nThe initial conventional approach to COVID was to encourage people to wash their hands (a good thing). As things worsened, the only other conventional idea was to quarantine. When the disease spun out of control our Government and conventional medicine panicked. They had no real therapies to help COVID-suffering patients except for supportive care.\n\nThankfully, a few conventional therapies, like hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, have been promoted\u201a\u00c4\u00eethough many in conventional medicine were downplaying it for far too long.\n\nAt my office, we were ready . The first 24 years of practicing holistic medicine was our time to figure out what worked and what did not work for people suffering from viral infections. That set us up to be ready for this pandemic.\n\nIn my blogs, I encouraged people to take high doses of vitamins A, C, D, and iodine at the first sign of an illness. In our practice, this was sufficient for the majority of our COVID patients. I (and my partners) have no doubt that the vast majority of COVID patients would avoid a deterioration of their symptoms if they started this protocol at the onset of symptoms.\n\nHowever, some became more ill or did not start the oral supplements early enough into their illness. Those patients needed additional holistic therapies. These included nebulizing hydrogen peroxide and iodine along with intravenous nutrient therapies.\n\nTo protect our staff and healthy patients, we did not treat sick COVID patients inside my office. We were gowning up and meeting our patients at their automobile at the back of our building and administering IVs and ozone therapies. Some of these patients were very sick. So far, they all recovered. I have shared some of their stories via a skype interview on previous blog posts.\n\nTo watch a few of our patient testimonials go to:\n\nThere Is Still Hope Out There (3/28/20): Christopher\n\nThere Is Still Hope Out There (3/30/20): Jeremiah\n\nThere Is Still Hope Out There (4/05/20): Kendra\n\nI think the end is in sight. We seem to be crossing over the hump of this dreadful disease. I have no doubt we will be in a much better position over the coming two weeks.\n\nFolks, I hope the Powers-That-Be learn from this catastrophe. In the future, we need to focus on supporting the host rather than conventional medicine\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s focus on killing the infectious organism. We do not have a vaccine or any other conventional therapy that is successful at destroying COVID.\n\nIn the future, I can guarantee you there will be other infectious illnesses that conventional medicine has no treatment to offer. Instead of waiting for the hail-Mary from conventional medicine, it is better to be prepared and have your body ready to fight back. This can be achieved by following my original instructions; eat a healthy diet, maintain optimal hydration, exercise, and correct nutrient imbalances with vitamin and mineral supplementation.\n\nIf you don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have a holistic doctor, it is past time to find one. At my office, we are happy to see you or do a telemed appointment. If you are interested in this please email Ann Salomon at info@centerforholisticmedicine.com.\n\nA holistic doctor can help you achieve your optimal health. Conventional doctors, on the other hand, are busy diagnosing pathology and prescribing the drug to treat that diagnosis. The problem with the conventional model is that the drug prescribed does not promote health as nearly all drugs poison enzymes and block receptors in the body.\n\nThere is a time and a place for drug therapies, but they are well over-prescribed in the US. The use of many drug therapies leaves the body depleted of vital nutrients that it will need when confronted with something like COVID.\n\nAs I previously stated, the Center for Holistic Medicine currently has 85 COVID patients who are all doing well and have not been hospitalized. There were some I was worried about\u201a\u00c4\u00eethey kept me up at night. I called them daily to monitor their progress.\n\nHaving them increase the frequency of nebulizing hydrogen peroxide and iodine helped them all. Some of the sickest were advised to nebulize every hour or two for a short period. IV therapies and ozone treatments have helped many.\n\nThis therapy has worked for helping COVID patients. It is sad that hospitalized COVID patients are not given the proper nutritional support when they are admitted.\n\nIn a perfect world, I would immediately start an IV of vitamin C and begin nebulizing any hospitalized COVID patient with hydrogen peroxide and iodine. I am sure that would markedly lower the need for mechanical ventilation.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nLike most holistic therapies, the earlier they are started in a disease process the better they perform. AT THE FIRST SIGN OF A VIRAL ILLNESS I ENCOURAGE MY PATIENTS TO START MY VIRAL PROTOCOL OF TAKING VITAMINS A, C, D AND IODINE. Due to the severity of COVID, I now recommend starting to nebulize hydrogen peroxide and iodine early into the illness as well.\n\nBetter times are coming. Keep me updated on how you are doing. I will much more to talk about in relation to COVID. More posts will be coming soon.\n\nTo All Our Health,\n\n~DrB\n\nSource."

                        "article_content": "Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s measures of success. But after a manic 3\u00ac\u03a9 years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.\n\nBy far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not going to play that game,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not uniform across states and across countries.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBut even beyond the death count, there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the official said.\n\nSome Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t been able to focus on getting the response right.\n\nTrump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSo it is a war and I define victory when it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said on May 1. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt can never be a total victory because too many people have died.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nWhen American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.\n\nOthers are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAllowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 argued one Republican close to the president.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sen. Lindsey Graham\n\nBut, he added, \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf things don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t look like they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re bouncing back by September, I think that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to be a problem.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe fear that Trump can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.\n\nWhen asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the \u201a\u00c4\u00faeconomic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nA spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.\n\nOthers are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)"

When the curtains fell on March 11, 2020, nobody knew that performance was going to be the musical's final bow on Broadway.\n\nNot only does this signify Broadway's first permanent closure due to the novel coronavirus, the news sets an uncertain future for many musicals considering how successful \"Frozen\" was.\n\nOver 1.3 million people turned up to watch Anna, Elsa, Olaf and Kristoff on the stage; the musical grossed over $150 million during its nearly two-year run. It was also nominated for the Best Musical Tony Award.\n\n\"I have to acknowledge our incredible audiences; night after night, the fans showed us how much they loved this show and we look forward to seeing them at 'Frozen' around the world,\" Schumacher concluded.\n\nTickets for the Broadway musical purchased via Ticketmaster will be refunded. Those who used other channels to secure tickets should contact their vendor.\n\nWhile its run on Broadway has come to an end, a future North American tour for \"Frozen\" is in the works. In addition, starting next year, the Disney musical will open in Australia, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom.\n\nDisney is the parent company of ABC News and \"Good Morning America.\""

                        "article_content": "Chicagoans are coping with the demands of social distancing differently. Some have transitioned to working from home, others are required to venture out each day to \u201a\u00c4\u00faessential\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 workplaces, and many are experiencing unemployment.\n\nWe took to the streets (while maintaining a 6-foot distance) to ask Chicago residents about their \u201a\u00c4\u00fanew normal\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 amid the coronavirus pandemic. Here\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s what they had to say:\n\nRicardo Davila, engineer\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m an electrical engineer, we do the sign and planning of different facilities. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been under self quarantine for the past couple of weeks which means I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been working from home. I typically do not do that. I avoid going outside at all costs but its a little bit hard to keep myself locked up all day. What I do is take moments like this to take a little break and go outside for a five minute, 10 minute walk. I keep myself away from people. I do not go to any public places where people could be and just keep some sort of healthy habits in my daily routine.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faMe personally, I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m an extrovert. I like to be around people, to talk to people. I love to talk to people so it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s been tough but I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been trying to identify that and be like I need to have discipline.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nJason, college student\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI think this is the first time I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve left my house since probably two weeks. I think it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s important to keep practicing social distancing even when you are out. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m trying to avoid visiting places and talking to other people. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m sure my mental health has declined staying inside the last two weeks. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s messing with my education. I haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t been able to go to school in three weeks now.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t even think things will really go back to normal, the way they were before this. It just changed the whole narrative for everything. It changed everything pretty much.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nNycole Stoudt, Service industry employee\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI work in the restaurant industry so we were kind of early on shut downs. I think everybody is a little nervous about what they are going to do to pay their bills, rent especially. We have zoom cocktail hours set up for later this evening to kind of bring everybody together and just say hi to each other.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe Sunday when Governor [J.B.] Pritzker announced restaurants and bars would be closing, that was a big moment for me where it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s like ok things are really going to change drastically and we all need to take the steps necessary to quell any further passing on of the virus to others. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s boring but it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not the worst thing in the world to have to stay in a little bit more.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nKaren and Richard Shapiro, retired\n\nKS: \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m 73 and he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 76, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re healthy. I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think about it. I kind of feel like by now if we don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have it we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re all carriers. I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s anybody who is not a carrier. I just use that mindset and be careful.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nRS: \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not concerned at all. There\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s so many people they haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t tested so they really don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know how extensive this could be, but they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re getting there.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nKS: \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll get through it.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nJoanna Griffin, Healthcare worker\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faUnfortunately I have to come out to defeat the battle and help the team out as much as possible. This is part of being in healthcare. For the team that I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m working for they are understaffed right now but everyone is just really trying to be optimistic and do the first thing first, making sure we take care of the patients.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been doing about five days a week and I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been going by METRA. The perfect thing about this is there aren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t too many people on the train. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not too bad. I had my concerns making sure they are clean on the trains. METRA is very good about that. I have no concerns about that, I know they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve definitely been doing their part of safety first.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBarry DeBois, Actor/Singer\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI was bartending between those things and then I quit my bartending job to start a theater gig and then that got canceled because all theater is being canceled at the moment. I still have to pay rent.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faBasically I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m trying to take gigs where I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m keeping my distance from people but those are very limited jobs. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve talked to friends in the theater community and they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re doing different stuff. Some people are teaching english to people in China. There are a lot of remote teaching opportunities people have gotten into.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIf I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not working in theater I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m working in the service industry and both of those are demolished right now. So I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know when I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m going to make normal money again which is kind of scary. We just moved into this new, beautiful apartment.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nTamas Vilaghy, Service industry employee\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI work at a wine shop and there was a bar component which has shut we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re figuring out if we can do take out and carry out and delivery. The wine shop has remained open so that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s giving me a little bit of income.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI live with my wife so it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nice to have someone there. We take a walk at night but that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s about it. She\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a musician so all of her gigs have dried up. She\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s trying to teach over zoom right now but it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s uncertain as well whether or not that can continue. The teachers I know are at a loss about this too.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9"

That is an increase of 1,347 cases from Thursday to Friday. The new numbers have not yet been recorded for Saturday.\n\nLast Friday, the daily case increase was 1,219.\n\nRegistered nurse April Lewis, center, prepares to administer a test at a newly opened United Memorial Medical Center COVID-19 drive-thru testing site, April 27, 2020, in Houston. David J. Phillip/AP\n\nWhile the cases are still well below New York, the state with the most confirmed cases at more than 345,000, the steady increase shows that the curve has not yet flattened in Texas.\n\nThe state also experienced its highest and second-highest daily death toll just a day apart. On Thursday, 58 deaths were recorded in 24 hours and Friday that number dropped only slightly to 56, according to the health department. The total number of fatalities is at 1,272.\n\nLast Friday, the daily death toll was 31.\n\nHospitalizations rates have appeared to flatten, but that data is reported on a two-week lag. Currently there are 1,716 people in a Texas hospital, according to the health department.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott's communications director John Wittman told ABC News that the amount of testing has doubled since reopening, contributing to the rise in cases.\n\n\"Since [COVID-19 testing] started, we did 330,000 tests in March and April. Since May 1, we have done over 330,000 -- so in 16 days we have doubled our testing from the previous entire two months,\" Wittman said.\n\n\"The governor has been clear that as the state of Texas conducts more tests, we will see the raw number of cases rise,\" Wittman said. \"However, the [rolling seven-day] average positivity rate has steadily declined from our high April 13 [of a bit more than 13%] to around 5% today. Our hospitalizations remain steady, and Texas has one of the lowest death rates per capita in the nation.\"\n\nTexas began reopening after its stay-at-home order was lifted on April 30.\n\nRestaurants are open for in-person dining at 25% capacity. Movie theaters and malls are also open at 25% capacity.\n\nMen receive haircuts as social distancing guidelines to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are relaxed at Doug's Barber Shop in Houston, Texas, May 8, 2020. Callaghan O'hare/Reuters\n\nRetail stores, libraries and museums are fully open. Come Monday, gyms will reopen too.\n\nThe two most populous counties -- Harris and Dallas -- have recorded the most cases. There are 8,817 confirmed cases in Harris County and 6,837 confirmed cases in Dallas County.\n\nThe state has tested nearly 646,000 people out of a population of 29 million. Cases are most likely higher because of how few people have been tested.\n\nABC News' Ali Dukakis contributed to this report.\n\nEditor's note: ABC News has updated this story to include comments from Gov. Greg Abbott's communications director."

Even though there is no way this could be proven, these are actions Nessel is willing to consider.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIn Michigan, that is the law,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Nessel said while making an appearance on CNN.\n\nTrending: Vicious Nursing Home Attacker Had COVID-19 and Was Quarantined Among the Elderly Despite Mental Illness and Felony Charges\n\nNessel says that she will be leaning on Ford and at the very least scolding them for allowing the President to come into their facility and wear a mask at his discretion.\n\ntake our poll - story continues below\n\nLOCKDOWN POLL: Should America reopen for business? \uf8ff\u00fc\u00ee\u00edLOCKDOWN POLL\uf8ff\u00fc\u00ee\u00ed Should America reopen for business?\n\nLOCKDOWN POLL: Should America reopen for business? * Yes, it's time to get back to work.

Not their fault, & I did put on a mask. No wonder many auto companies left Michigan, until I came along! \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 22, 2020\n\nPresident Trump has generally avoided wearing a mask to set an example for Americans not to submit to fear while the fake news media pumps non-stop coronavirus hysteria to Americans who are essentially being held hostage by the shutdown.\n\nBig League Politics reported on how the president thumbed his nose at Nessel and all of the thugs within Gov. Gretchen Whitmer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s administration before his visit to the Ford plant:\n\nFord will not threaten Trump with an ultimatum to wear the mask. Trump has avoided wearing a mask during public appearances, showing that he will not succumb to the mass hysteria. The president is setting an example for ordinary Americans to overcome the media-induced panic. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAs we have said previously, we shared our safety policies and recommendations with the White House in advance of this visit. The White House has its own safety and testing policies in place and will make its own determination,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ford said in a statement. Trump has refused the advice of the deep state bureaucracy, which wants to scare people into wearing masks. The mask has emerged as a sign of cowardice and obsequiousness throughout the pandemic. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe CDC is advising the use of non-medical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure. So it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s voluntary. You don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have to do it. But they suggest it for a period of time. I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m going to be doing it,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Trump said.\n\nBecause Nessel cannot do anything against Trump other than whine, she may attempt to punish the Ford plant and put more people on the unemployment line due to her tantrum."

                        "article_title": "Democrats push new $3T coronavirus relief bill through House",
                        "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Democrats have powered a massive $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill through the House, an election-year measure designed to brace a U.S. economy in free fall and a health care system struggling to contain a pandemic still pummeling the country.\n\nFriday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 208-199 vote, with all but one Republican opposed, advances what boils down to a campaign-season display of Democratic economic and health-care priorities. It has no chance of becoming law as written, but will likely spark difficult negotiations with the White House and Senate Republicans. Any product would probably be the last major COVID-19 response bill before November\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s presidential and congressional elections.\n\nThe enormous Democratic measure would cost more than the prior four coronavirus bills combined. It would deliver almost $1 trillion for state and local governments, another round of $1,200 direct payments to individuals and help for the unemployed, renters and homeowners, college debt holders and the struggling Postal Service.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faNot to act now is not only irresponsible in a humanitarian way, it is irresponsible because it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s only going to cost more,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 warned House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. \u201a\u00c4\u00faMore in terms of lives, livelihood, cost to the budget, cost to our democracy.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nRepublicans mocked the bill as a bloated Democratic wish-list that was dead on arrival in the GOP-led Senate and, for good measure, faced a White House veto threat. Party leaders say they want to assess how $3 trillion approved earlier is working and see if some states\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 partial business reopenings would spark an economic revival that would ease the need for more safety net programs.\n\nRepublicans are also sorting through internal divisions and awaiting stronger signals from President Donald Trump about what he will support.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faPhase Four is going to happen,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, using Washington insider-speak for the measure. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to happen in a much better way for the American people.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nTrump and top Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are insisting the next measure should protect reopening businesses from liability lawsuits. The president is also demanding a cut to payroll taxes, but GOP leaders are not yet onboard.\n\nThe daylong debate painted a Capitol scene that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s become common in the era of coronavirus, even as it remains disconcerting. The sparsely populated House floor was dotted with lawmakers and aides wearing protective masks and even gloves, though some Republicans lacked them.\n\nMany members looked shaggier and sported beards they had not worn weeks ago. Roll call votes lasted over an hour each because lawmakers were voting in small groups to limit crowding.\n\nTo enhance the bill\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s political impact, Democrats named their measure \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe Heroes Act\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 for the payments it would provide front-line emergency workers. With more than 86,000 Americans dead, 1.4 million confirmed infections and 36 million filing unemployment claims in an frozen economy, Democrats saw GOP opposition as an easy campaign-season target.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faAre you kidding me?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, of Republican assertions that it was time to stop spending more money. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhere do you guys live? Food lines at our food banks around the block? In the United States of America?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nRepublicans saw the bill as a Democratic political blunder. They said overly generous unemployment benefits discouraged people from returning to work, and attacked language helping immigrants in the U.S. illegally get federal benefits. They also singled out provisions helping states set up voting by mail and easing the marijuana industry\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s access to banks.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt may help the cannabis industry, but it won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t help Main Street,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\n\nPelosi pushed the measure through after overcoming party divisions aggravated by election pressures. Some moderate Democrats opposed the package for its price tag and politically fraught provisions like assisting marijuana businesses. A few progressive Democrats were upset because it did not do more, such as guaranteeing workers\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 salaries and bolstering their health insurance coverage.\n\nFourteen Democrats voted against the measure. Nearly all are centrists and number among the party\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s most vulnerable lawmakers in November\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s elections: freshmen from districts Trump won in 2016.\n\nAmong them was Rep. Cindy Axne of Iowa, who labeled the measure \u201a\u00c4\u00fabloated.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Another, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, tweeted, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis bill strays far beyond delivering relief or responding to an urgent crisis, & it has no chance at becoming law.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nRepublicans were already planning to use the day\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s votes against other moderate Democrats who backed Friday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s legislation and face competitive reelection races.\n\nClearly, the bipartisan consensus that produced four previous coronavirus bills was crumbling quickly. Polls show GOP voters are satisfied with the federal response and aren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t agitating for more. Self-branded deficit hawks are citing the massive increase in the spiraling $25 trillion national debt.\n\nSome congressional aides said the Democratic bill\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s real price tag could breach $3.5 trillion. A partial estimate of tax provisions alone revealed eye-popping costs: $412 billion to renew $1,200 cash payments to individuals, more than $100 billion to pay health insurance premiums for the unemployed and $164 billion to make an \u201a\u00c4\u00faemployee retention\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 tax credit for businesses more generous.\n\nRepublicans leaders faced disunity between conservatives who feel enough has been done and pragmatists who back rescuing the Postal Service from looming insolvency and delivering cash to revenue-starved state and local governments. The huge price tag and a lack of consultation with Republicans by Pelosi cemented GOP opposition.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThis bill is nothing more than the Democratic policy agenda masquerading as a response to the coronavirus crisis,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla. He said the bill is \u201a\u00c4\u00fagoing nowhere, and is going nowhere fast.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nLiberal Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., also opposed the bill. She told reporters that if constituents ask her if the bill would put money in their pockets or preserve their health care, \u201a\u00c4\u00faI can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t tell them yes.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe lone Republican backing the legislation was Rep. Peter King of New York, who is retiring."

A GoFundMe fundraiser has raised over $200,000.\n\nCordero played a mob soldier with a flair for the dramatic in 2014 in Broadway\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Woody Allen 1994 film adaptation of \u201a\u00c4\u00faBullets Over Broadway,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 for which he received a Tony nomination for best featured actor in a musical. He moved to Los Angeles to star in \u201a\u00c4\u00faRock of Ages.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe lanky Cordero originated the menacing role of husband Earl opposite his estranged wife, played by Jessie Mueller, in \u201a\u00c4\u00faWaitress\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 on Broadway, as well as the role of Sonny in Chazz Palminteri\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faA Bronx Tale.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nOn the small screen, Cordero appeared in several episodes of \u201a\u00c4\u00faBlue Bloods\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00faLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 as well as \u201a\u00c4\u00faLilyhammer\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and he had a role in the film \u201a\u00c4\u00faGoing in Style.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe virus has sickened other Broadway veterans, including the actors Danny Burstein, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Gavin Creel, Aaron Tveit and Laura Bell Bundy as well as composer David Bryan.

                    "article_content": "Experts predict string of quarantines in Russia before 2021\n\nRussia is going to see four scenarios with the development of the coronavirus pandemic. The most probable one of them is described as push-and-pull: repeated waves of morbidity and a string of quarantines until 2021.\n\nExperts at the international consulting company Boston Consulting Group (BCG) believe that according to one of the four scenarios, the virus would be stopped, and the crisis would be limited to only one wave. In this case, the country will lose 4-6% of GDP. Non-food retail businesses and services would be suspended as a result of the lockdown, which may last for about two months in each region. Businesses will recover quickly after the lockdown ends. However, many small businesses will close, which will increase the level of unemployment.\n\nUnder the critical recession scenario, Russia will lose 10-15% of GDP. The virus crisis will last longer, and the country will see stringent quarantine measures. Industrial production and construction will stop, which will lead to a decrease in demand for resources, primarily hydrocarbons and steel. A large-scale liquidity crisis will begin throughout the Russian economy, which will put an excessive burden on the banking system.\n\nAnother scenario would be similar to the period, in which Russia found herself in the early 1990s after the collapse of the USSR. In this scenario, the world will see long-term recession in global economy, but BCG experts do not see any prerequisites for it.\n\nIn the most plausible scenario of quarantine cycles, Russia's GDP will decline by 7-10% compared to 5%, which the Central Bank and Finance Minister Anton Siluanov predicted. Bursts of morbidity are possible before the end of 2021, because the coronavirus vaccine will be released no earlier than in late 2020.\n\nA long lockdown will lead to numerous bankruptcies in small and medium-sized businesses. In this scenario, the government will be opening and closing the economy depending on the incidence rate. Long-term lockdown will lead to further decline in the sector of services and retail, a drop in demand for real estate and a decrease in production and wholesale trade.\n\nExperts recommend the Russian authorities expand the capacity of medical institutions after quarantine ends, make quarantine more predictable and shorter, and use decisive measures to support the economy during lockdown. If quarantines are short enough (less than 25% of the total pandemic period), it would be cheaper for the state to subsidize wages during this period rather than to support a sharply increased number of unemployed people."

Each test costs 950 rubles ($13), with an extra 200-300 rubles ($3-4) charged for the process of taking the sample. The company is accepting anyone who wants to be tested, apart from those displaying symptoms of an acute respiratory viral infection.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faA positive result indicating the formation of an immune response was detected in 14% of patients.

In the future, Invitro plans to launch a \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Covid Index\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 on its website, which would display data by city, gender, and age.\n\nIn their press release, Invitro explained that antibody testing can provide a more reliable indication of the extent of the pandemic.\n\nOn May 15, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin announced that the capital city would be rolling out a vast random screening program. According to the mayor, mass testing will enable the government to make more informed decisions about anti-coronavirus measures.\n\nAlso on rt.com Moscow mayor launches unprecedented FREE MASS TESTING system for coronavirus antibodies\n\nIf you like this story, share it with a friend!"

                    "article_content": "(Natural News) China has finally admitted to destroying samples of coronavirus early in the outbreak, but they\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4re insisting they did it out of safety concerns rather than as part of any sort of coverup. Given their track record, however, doubts remain about the true motivation behind the move.\n\nA supervisor for China\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4s National Health Commission, Liu Dengfeng, finally admitted in a news conference that the government there issued an order on January 3 directing some facilities to dispose of coronavirus samples. Liu said the order was a measure that aimed to \u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00faprevent the risk to laboratory biological safety and prevent secondary disasters caused by unidentified pathogens.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nLiu added that the labs had been \u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00faunauthorized\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f9 to handle the samples and therefore had to destroy them to comply with public health laws in the country. He stopped short of specifying how the samples were destroyed or why those labs had them in the first place.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been accusing China for months of destroying the samples to cover up the extent of the country\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4s outbreak. Last month, he expressed frustration with the Chinese government for not sharing virus samples from within the country with the rest of the world \u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00ec something that makes it impossible to assess the evolution of the disease.\n\nHe has also accused the country of censoring coronavirus research and trying to influence international efforts to fight the disease. He criticized the country for taking too long to report the outbreak to the World Health Organization and said that even when they did notify them, they failed to share all of the information at their disposal.\n\nLast week, he said: \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe Chinese Communist Party tried to suppress information about this virus, about where it began, about how it started, about how it was being transmitted from human to human, indeed employed the World Health Organization to further that storyline.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe U.S. has been impacted disproportionately by the disease, with almost one quarter of the world\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4s infections and deaths being seen in America. So far, more than 4.59 million people have tested positive for the disease globally and at least 309,000 have died according to official numbers \u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00ec although the real death toll is widely believed to be far higher.\n\nPresident Trump has said he\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4s \u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00favery disappointed in China\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f9 and that he has no desire to talk to Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nIntelligence reports show China acted irresponsibly\n\nA report from the department of Homeland Security shows that American officials believe that China intentionally covered up how severe the pandemic was in early January while hoarding medical supplies. Meanwhile, a leaked dossier by the Five Eyes intelligence alliance outlines how Beijing has caused some whistleblowers to mysteriously \u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00fadisappear\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f9 and scrubbed mentions of the disease in its early stages from the internet while destroying virus samples. They called their actions an \u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00faassault on international transparency.\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f9\n\nOther intelligence agencies have reached similar findings. For example, Der Spiegel reported on a German intelligence document that suggests the Chinese president personally pressured the Director-General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, into holding back info about human-to-human transmission and delaying a pandemic warning.\n\nIn fact, Germany\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4s Federal Intelligence Service estimated that China\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4s actions \u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00falost four to six weeks to fight the virus worldwide.\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f9\n\nIs it any surprise that the majority of Americans view China negatively and have no confidence in President Xi?\n\nWe already knew that China destroyed those samples, so admitting to doing so and making up an excuse for it isn\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4t going to do much to make them look any better. In fact, it will only add fuel to the rumors of coverups that are going on in the country, including those surrounding how this disease came into existence in the first place. If they were really so worried about \u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00fasafety,\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f9 they would have acted far differently from the\u221a\u00c7 start of this pandemic, and thousands of people around the world who have died in the last few months might still be alive and with their loved ones today.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nNYPost.com\n\nNewsweek.com\n\nDailyMail.co.uk\n\nPewResearch.org"

                    "article_content": "How A Virtual Powwow Helped Heal A Spirit Broken During The Pandemic\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Kay Oxendine Courtesy of Kay Oxendine\n\nIt's powwow season \u201a\u00c4\u00ee the time of year when across the country, Native American tribes should be getting together to celebrate their culture with food, dancing, singing and drumming. Kay Oxendine is a member of the Haliwa Saponi Tribe in North Carolina.\n\n\"Every year we know it's coming; like, the birds sing differently,\" she told NPR. \"It's almost like spring arrives when the powwow does.\"\n\nOxendine is an author and educator and the mistress of ceremonies for a number of powwows in the eastern U.S. It's a job she loves: telling stories to the crowd and introducing the dancers, singers and drummers. She was set to be the first woman to emcee her tribe's powwow, scheduled for Friday, April 17, to Sunday April 19, at the Tribal Ceremonial Grounds in Hollister, N.C.\n\nAbout 5,000 people would've been there, but she knew it would be canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. What she says she didn't expect was that her mind and body were still expecting the celebration.\n\n\"So I wake up on Friday morning and it's like I wake up and I open my eyes and I'm looking, oh, my God, it's here! Literally was like a kid. And I jumped out of bed, and I'm like YAY, and I said to my son, it's powwow time. And he was like, 'Mom.' \"\n\nShe felt physically ill.\n\n\"I actually threw up. I actually I got physically ill. It felt like I was pregnant but couldn't give birth.\"\n\nThen, she says she noticed on Facebook that a member of the Haliwa Saponi Tribal Council had scheduled a virtual Haliwa powwow. \"And I'm like, man, you know, stop, what are you doing?\" It seemed like such a strange idea.\n\nBut she says it was wonderful \"because what she did, she encouraged people to still dress in their regalia. And so one of our previous tribal administrators, Archie Lynch, who is also my cousin, he lit a fire and he was out there and he had sage. He was blessing the grounds. It was in his backyard. But, you know, it just meant the world to me.\"\n\nFollowing the powwow, there's normally an after party with a deejay. This year, one of the tribal members held a virtual after party.\n\n\"We were brought up on Otis Redding and soul music around here \u201a\u00c4\u00ee music that just makes you want to get up and dance,\" she says.\n\nSo Oxendine got up and danced.\n\n\"I'm sitting in my room, the music is blasting. I'm sitting in front of my computer, I'm dancing in my living room. My son thinks I've lost my mind. \"\n\nIt was just what her spirit needed.\n\n\"It was it was just the most beautiful thing I think I've ever encountered. It helped me. It really helped me heal a lot.\""

                    "article_title": "Obama emerges as central figure in 2020 presidential race",
                    "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Nearly eight years after he was last on the ballot, Barack Obama is emerging as a central figure in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nDemocrats are eagerly embracing Obama as a political wingman for Joe Biden, who spent two terms by his side as vice president. Obama remains the party\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s most popular figure, particularly with black voters and younger Democrats, and Biden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s presidential campaign is planning for him to have a highly visible role in the months to come.\n\nFor President Donald Trump, that means an opportunity to focus the spotlight on one of his favorite political foils. In recent days, Trump and his allies have aggressively pushed conspiracy theories about Obama designed to fire up the president\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s conservative base, taint Biden by association and distract from the glut of grim health and economic news from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faPartisans on both sides want to make this about Obama,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Ned Price, who served as spokesperson for Obama\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s White House National Security Council.\n\nThe renewed political focus on Obama sets the stage for an election about the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s future that will also be about its past. As Biden looks to Obama for personal validation, he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s also running to restore some of the former president\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s legacy, which has been systematically dismantled by Trump. The current president is running in part to finish that job.\n\nYet Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s anti-Obama push also frequently takes on a darker, more conspiratorial tone that goes far beyond differences in health care policy and America\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s role in the world. His current focus is on the actions Obama, Biden and their national security advisers took in the closing days of their administration, as they viewed intelligence reports about Michael Flynn. Flynn had a short-lived stint as Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s national security adviser before being fired for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his interactions with Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ambassador to the U.S.\n\nTrump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s own administration acknowledged on Wednesday that Obama advisers followed proper procedures in privately \u201a\u00c4\u00faunmasking\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Flynn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s name, which was redacted in the intelligence reports for privacy reasons. Flynn ultimately pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, though Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Justice Department moved last week to drop the case against him.\n\nDespite there being no evidence of wrongdoing by Obama, Biden or other administration officials, Trump is eagerly pushing the notion of an unspecified crime against the former president, branding it \u201a\u00c4\u00faObamagate.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s being backed up by Republican allies, including Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley who took to the Senate floor this week to ask of the Flynn matter: \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat did Obama and Biden know, and when did they know it?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nTrump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s zeal has sparked fears among some former Obama and Biden advisers about how far he may be willing to go in using the levers of government to push his case against them in an election year. The Justice Department is conducting an investigation into the origins of the Russia probe that ensnared Flynn and other Trump associates.\n\nTrump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s renewed focus on Obama comes as Republicans grow increasingly anxious that the rising coronavirus death toll and cratering economy will damage the president\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s reelection prospects in November. More than 84,000 Americans have died from the virus, and more than 30 million have claimed unemployment.\n\nBiden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s campaign drew a direct connection between the president\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attacks on Obama and the twin crises battering his administration.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s no surprise that the president is erratically lashing out at President Obama, desperate to distract from his own failures as commander in chief that have cost thousands of Americans their lives during this crisis,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said TJ Ducklo, a Biden campaign spokesman.\n\nTrump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s emphasis on Obama also comes as the former president begins to emerge from a three-year period of political restraint as he prepares to embrace his role as leading surrogate for Biden. Last week, Obama told a large gathering of alumni from his administration that DOJ\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s decision to drop the Flynn case put the \u201a\u00c4\u00farule of law at risk.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 He also criticized the Trump White House\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBiden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s campaign has been eager to get Obama involved in the election, though his exact role is still forming, particularly given that the pandemic has upended the campaign\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s plans for rallies and other in-person events in battleground states. The former president is also expected to campaign for Democratic House and Senate candidates across the country.\n\nThough Obama campaigned for Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterms, he has mostly tried to avoid overt politics since leaving the White House. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s spoken out publicly against Trump on rare occasions, frustrating many Democrats who have wanted him to be more aggressive in calling out his successor.\n\nBut the 2020 election has always loomed as the moment when Obama would step off the sidelines, and he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s told advisers he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s eager to do so. Despite his strident public neutrality during the Democratic primary, he spoke to Biden regularly and has continued to do so as the campaign moves into the general election, according to aides.\n\nBiden\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s campaign sees Obama as a clear asset as they seek to not only energize Democrats,but to also appeal to independents and more moderate Republicans who may be wary of four more years of Trump in the White House.\n\nA recent Monmouth University poll found 57% of Americans say they have a favorable opinion of Obama. That includes 92% of Democrats and 19% of Republicans.\n\nObama\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s favorable ratings are higher than either of the men who will be on the ballot in November. The same poll showed 41% of Americans had a favorable opinion of Biden, and 40% viewed Trump in a favorable light."

But she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s turned out to be so much more.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faBeing alone at home kind of is hard,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 says George, \u201a\u00c4\u00fabut with a pet you have someone to take care of, someone to play with you, someone to greet you in the morning, so it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s kind of like really calming and comforting.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nWhether it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a dog, a cat or, yes, a hedgehog named Quillie Nelson, pets are proving to be unexpected heroes in lockdown. They include the newly adopted and fostered like Lala; people have flooded shelters, looking for pets to fill their extra hours at home.\n\nLaura Evans, her husband and their three kids brought 12-week-old Zoe to their Bethesda, Maryland, home after the pandemic hit. The squirmy Yorkshire terrier needs constant attention, and they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re happy to oblige.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe wanted to bring a little light and life to our house,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Evans said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faShe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a cuddly work, homework sidekick. Everyone wants to hang with her.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nNancy Karan said her pet Shadow gets her out of her New York apartment for quality time with her fellow dog walkers, at a safe distance. At night they sleep together, \u201a\u00c4\u00fabecause it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s very comforting just to have his body on my bed.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nIn Houston, Quillie Nelson and other pets help maintain routines for Rachael Pavlik and two teens.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI think having pets during a scary time like this is good for the whole family. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s good for the kids to have a sense of normalcy and a sense of responsibility, like they have to get out of bed before noon to feed their animals,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said.\n\nKitty Block, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, urged more people to foster and adopt as the health crisis worsens.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt frees up space in the shelter to take these animals in that may be displaced because their family member, their owner is ill or financially in a troubled situation,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said.\n\nWhile many people seek comfort, some frustrations have surfaced with all the togetherness. Professional dog trainer Nicole Ellis in Los Angeles, of the service Rover.com, said owners should make a conscious effort to tire out their animals before a Zoom meeting or important phone call.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t blame them if they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re like, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m bored! I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m bored!\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 and they haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t done anything all day. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not their fault,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said.\n\nThat doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t seem to be a problem for Squiggles, a bearded dragon in South Orange, New Jersey. Dan Cohen\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 13-year-old daughter, Julia, has survived with help from her chill lizard, who has her own emotional support vest and tiny mask.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want her catching coronavirus,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he joked.\n\nAubrey Fine, a licensed psychologist and professor emeritus at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona said the relationship is mutually beneficial between humans and animals.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIn a time of tremendous and unique life challenges, goodness is still around us. When you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re looking at souls, animals touch human souls and humans touch animal souls. And together serendipity can happen.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9"

                    "article_title": "Just Like 9/11 Did, COVID-19 Is Shifting Human Consciousness In A Major Way",
                    "article_content": "In Brief The Facts: Major events have a lasting impact on human consciousness, and help people see what they once never saw before. This appears to be happening with the new coronavirus.\n\nReflect On: How do events like 9/11, and the new coronavirus impact human consciousness?\n\nIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s truly an exciting time to be alive, and that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s because more and more people are \u201a\u00c4\u00fawaking up\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to concepts about our reality and the overall human experience that they were once previously unaware of. This has been happening for decades, but every single year it seems to amplify, and the process of our \u201a\u00c4\u00f2awakening\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 seems to accelerate rapidly.\n\nThis type of \u201a\u00c4\u00f2awakening\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 happens in all areas that surround human life. People learn deep truths about health and medicine, education, geopolitics, consciousness, extraterrestrials and much more. The idea that a small group of corporations and the people that run them have a strong hold on our perception, thoughts, emotions, and reactions regarding information and major world events is now far from a mere \u201a\u00c4\u00faconspiracy theory\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in the eyes of many. It can be seen quite clearly, and mainstream media has been exposed as the true bearer of \u201a\u00c4\u00fafake news\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 by many people.\n\nEvents like the coronavirus simply accelerate the process of awakening, and expose mainstream media outlets for what they truly are in this moment. There\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a reason why mainstream media has such strong connections to intelligence agencies and have their roots in psychological warfare. You can find documentation and examples of that in an article I published a while ago here.\n\nA quote from Edward Bernays, known as the father of public relations, is powerful because it sums up these thoughts quite well:\n\nThe conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.\n\nCurrent Events & Collective Consciousness\n\nWhen 9/11 happened, we were told that terrorists attacked the World Trade Centre. As the months and years went on, more and more people grew suspicious of their government\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s explanation of what happened that day, this included many politicians and academics as well, further adding fuel to the fire. Evidence came forward, science was done and whistleblowers spoke out, giving us a very clear idea that what we were told happened that day, most certainly did not. Today, many polls show that more than half of the American people alone don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t believe the official explanation of what really happened that day. Since 9/11, hundreds of millions of people have become aware of \u201a\u00c4\u00fafalse flag\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 terrorism, which is the idea that the \u201a\u00c4\u00f2powers that be\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 created these events, fund terrorism, stage them, and then use these events to justify the infiltration of another country for ulterior motives. They basically create the problem, in several different ways, and then propose the solution.\n\nOrganizations like Wikileaks and whistleblowers like Edward Snowden have proved, as well as explained, how events like these are used to justify a heightening national security state, one where more and more of our basic rights and freedoms are stripped from us under the guise of \u201a\u00c4\u00f2goodwill.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\n\nBut these events have shifted human consciousness. People become aware of how our world truly works and functions, a process we call \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Breaking The Illusion\u201a\u00c4\u00f2 here at CE. People begin to see that the world they think is real is actually not, and that things like corruption exist within the geopolitical realm, an important realization if you wish to reflect on whether our political process truly serves us or not. This then changes the perception of people around the world, causing us to choose new paths and actions as to how to live our lives in society. Paths that would not change if we never \u201a\u00c4\u00f2broke the illusion.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\n\nAnother major event is happening right now, the COVID-19 pandemic. When it comes to COVID-19, what has many people asking questions is the ban and censorship of information. For example, YouTube is now actively banning any content that contradicts anything that the World Health Organization (WHO) states with regards to the new coronavirus. Vimeo recently banned a documentary exposing \u201a\u00c4\u00faBig Pharma\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 influence within the WHO. These blatant forms of censorship have some upset, but many others see it as an eyebrow-raising moment, showing quite clearly the corruption that exists in our world and the efforts that are put forth to control the perception of the masses. We then begin to ask why?\n\nControlling information and what people think is important if you wish to control their lives. This is why \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Breaking The Illusion\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 is one of the first steps in the CE formula to shift consciousness. After all, why do you think people like Julian Assange are in jail, and people like Edward Snowden are living in exile?\n\nHow far have we sunk if telling the truth becomes a crime? How far have we sunk if we prosecute people that expose war crimes for exposing war crimes? How far have we sunk when we no longer prosecute our own war criminals? Because we identify more with them, than we identify with their people that actually expose these crimes. What does that tell about us and about our governments? In a democracy, the power does not belong to the government, but to the people. But the people have to claim it. Secrecy disempowers the people because it prevents them from exercising democratic control, which is precisely why governments want secrecy. Nils Melzer (source)\n\nWith COVID-19, we are also seeing a large number of people questioning the measures that multiple governments have taken to lockdown countries. We are seeing people question the information that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s being put out by our federal health agencies, including the World Health Organization. We have seen a number of scientists in the field, as well as doctors, also question the official narratives, and we have seen people like Edward Snowden, and many more, explain how this \u201a\u00c4\u00f2pandemic\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 is being used for ulterior motives. You can access those articles at the end of this article if you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re interested.\n\nI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve said it before and I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll say it again, we are now living in a time where a digital authoritarian \u201a\u00c4\u00f2fact checker\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 is patrolling the internet and censoring content it deems as \u201a\u00c4\u00f2false.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 It does not matter if the information is true or false, backed by science or not, or whether it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s simply an opinion, if it doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t align with the mainstream narrative, you are not meant to see it or trust it. Should people not have the right to examine information, check sources, decide for themselves what is real and what is fake?\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nCOVID-19 has simply accelerated the process of awakening, and it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s also made even more people aware of the censorship of information that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s taking place. Along with the censorship of information, comes ridicule, and bashing by mainstream media in order to oppose and instantaneously shut down any opposite narrative.\n\nNarratives that go against mainstream media narratives are not acknowledged or countered, they are simply ridiculed and deemed a \u201a\u00c4\u00faconspiracy theory.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe point is, events like this serve the collective. They wake us up, they help us see, they help shift the perceptions about our world and our world \u201a\u00c4\u00f2leaders\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 and serve as a catalyst for more people to start asking questions, and to see that what we are told is not always what is. This is why events as such, although hard in many senses, and real in many ways, do indeed move humanity forward in a \u201a\u00c4\u00f2positive\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 direction. What\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s happening now is not a tragedy, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s exciting, and it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not as bad as they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve made it out to be.

The county\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s death toll rose Thursday to 2,021, with more than 42,000 confirmed cases.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is a very sad milestone for us,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 county Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Thursday after the deaths exceeded 2,000.\n\nLos Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis said she hoped officials could ease stay-at-home restrictions soon but urged caution.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI wish that we could speed things up,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe virus is still out there waiting for us to let our guard down.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nDespite the average daily death toll, which has remained at a stubborn plateau for weeks, there were new signs that even Los Angeles is beginning to turn the corner.\n\nThe coronavirus transmission rate in the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s most populous county is now in its best position since the magnitude of the outbreak became clear in March.\n\nStill, officials remain concerned that warm temperatures and quarantine fatigue could drive people from their homes over the Memorial Day weekend, resulting in crowding at parks and beaches that could threaten to undo some of the progress the state has made.\n\nIn San Francisco, the parks department painted 10-foot circles on the grass of four city parks ahead of the holiday weekend to remind visitors to follow social distancing rules.\n\nIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s part of a pilot program based on a similar effort at Domino Park in Brooklyn, said Tamara Barak Aparton, spokeswoman for San Francisco Recreation and Parks.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to be warm this weekend and we knew people would be out, so we thought it would be a good time to get feedback on whether this helps,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Aparton said. If successful, the circles could be expanded to more locations, she said.\n\nIn Orange County, several coastal cities expanded their beach hours and planned to open more parking lots connected to the shoreline ahead of the holiday.\n\nSeal Beach, which initially allowed public access only Mondays through Thursdays from sunrise to sunset, is now welcoming beachgoers from 4:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week, officials said earlier this week. Some beach parking lots also reopened. Beaches are open for active use only.\n\nA few miles south, Huntington Beach and Newport Beach also are allowing beach access on weekends, ahead of the Memorial Day holiday. Newport is now open 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., while Huntington Beach opens an hour earlier.\n\nLaguna Beach, however, is maintaining stricter hours on Saturdays and Sundays, with its coastline closing at noon each day.\n\nWhile Los Angeles County beaches also have reopened for active use, only some parking lots are open.\n\nIn addition to the reduced transmission rate, L.A. County has seen other encouraging indicators, including a 12% decrease in its latest seven-day average of deaths per day and a 15% decrease in its most recent three-day average for hospitalizations per day, Ferrer said Thursday.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe progress we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve made in slowing the spread, the reduction in the average daily deaths and hospitalizations and retaining capacity in our health care system \u201a\u00c4\u00ee this lets us know that the extraordinary efforts and sacrifices made by all of you are working,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAs a community, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve done this together, and this progress is a direct reflection of what all of you in your day-to-day lives have been able to accomplish.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nStill, she said, officials will continue to keep a close eye on those metrics to ensure they don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t creep up as more people are out in the public due to businesses and recreation areas reopening.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThrough our recovery journey, as we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re all out of our homes more, it may become more difficult to slow the spread, but it is far from impossible,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said.\n\nThough experts say it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s still too soon for L.A. County to move into a more aggressive phase of recovery, much of California has progressed to a point where officials feel it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s safe to lift more of the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s stay-at-home order and allow more businesses to reopen.\n\nThe number of new coronavirus cases across the state declined from the previous week, and hospitalizations have dropped more than 15% from a peak six weeks ago, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis.\n\nMost counties have received approval to progress more quickly through Phase 2 of the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s reopening road map \u201a\u00c4\u00ee meaning they can open restaurant dining rooms and more retail businesses for in-store shopping.\n\nThe list of counties that can ramp up their reopening efforts now includes San Diego \u201a\u00c4\u00ee the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s second-most populous \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Kern, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura.\n\nThat comes as officials revealed that California\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unemployment rate nearly tripled from mid-March to mid-April, with the state losing an unprecedented 2.3 million payroll jobs across all sectors of its economy as a result of the pandemic.\n\nApril\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s jobless rate skyrocketed to 15.5%, up from 5.5% a month before, sweeping past the Great Recession\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s peak of 12.3% a decade ago, state officials reported Friday.\n\nThe Golden State\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s jobless rate is higher than the nationwide rate of 14.7%, reflecting California\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s reliance on tourism, hospitality and entertainment businesses.\n\nStill, some local officials are urging tourists to stay away \u201a\u00c4\u00ee at least for now. Multiple counties have expressed concern about people visiting and possibly bringing with them the coronavirus, especially during the Memorial Day weekend.\n\nDr. Penny Borenstein, San Luis Obispo County\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s health officer, asked tourists to not visit as the county reopened many shops and restaurants this week. While officials have performed \u201a\u00c4\u00faspot checks\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 with hotels to deter tourism, Borenstein said the county would cite visitors only in the case of \u201a\u00c4\u00faegregious violations.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nRemote Alpine County urged tourists to stay away when the virus began to spread through California in March.\n\nDr. Richard Johnson, the Alpine County public health officer, said last month there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s no medical care to treat visitors who fall ill with COVID-19.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThere\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s no way we would even have ground or air resources to get them out,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Johnson said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a dangerous assumption that you can come and look at us as a safe haven. It is an unsafe haven.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nCommunities in the Lake Tahoe region, which heavily depend on tourism as well, have issued reminders before the holiday weekend warning that leisure travel is not permitted.\n\nOn its website, the city of South Lake Tahoe said that while second homeowners are now welcome, other visitors are still not. Lodging will not be available to short-term renters.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe would love nothing more than to welcome everyone to Tahoe right now, but that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not the safest way to bring people back to South Lake,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 City Manager Joe Irvin said in a statement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe need to be responsible and make sure we are doing our part to keep our neighbors safe and Tahoe safe while adhering to the governor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s stay at home orders.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00ee\u201a\u00c4\u00ee\u201a\u00c4\u00ee\n\n(Bierman reported from Washington.

                    "article_content": "Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb: 'We used to do a lot of travel for work and then we entertained ourselves on screens. That's going to inverse.'\n\nDia Dipasupil/Getty Images for Tribeca Film Festival\n\nAirbnb is about connecting people. Before this crisis, we brought 2 million people together a day, and when this crisis ends, we're going to get back to doing just that. But to get there, we are going to need to be scrappy. We're going to be nimble, we're going to simplify our operations and focus on what makes us different: our community of hosts.\n\nNo one knows for sure [how the crisis will change the travel industry], but I can give you two thoughts. First, when the comeback starts, it will start locally. People are going to take trips that are close to home and they're going to want something affordable. Second, I think we're seeing that you can do a lot [via] video conferencing, and that's going to have a big impact on how often people travel for work. Business travel isn't going to go away, but I think it's going to look very different in the future.\n\nWe used to do a lot of travel for work and then we entertained ourselves on screens. That's going to inverse. I think we'll work more on screens and entertain ourselves in the real world.\n\nI also think many people are realizing they don't have to be tethered to one city. So you'll see more people who are going to choose to live around the world, spending a few months at a time in different places. And we're going to focus in part on longer-term stays to better serve those people.\n\nI've also been thinking about what won't change. In 1950, 25 million people crossed a border, and last year 1.4 billion people did. That happened because there is an innate human desire to travel, to explore and that is never going to go away. Travel may be on pause, but it's going to come back."

It was provided to Yahoo News by one of its recipients under the condition that that recipient not be identified.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faAs most states have begun phased re-opening, several COVID-19 hot spots continue to emerge,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the notice says. Three counties are then listed: Palm Beach; San Bernardino County, Calif.; and Marshall County, Ala.\n\nThe Gardens Mall food court opened Friday morning for the first time in nearly two months. (Damon Higgins/Palm Beach Post via Zuma Wire) More\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faPalm Beach County, FL reported a 71% increase in new cases the last 7 days compared to the previous 7 days,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the document explains. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe state authorized Palm Beach County to begin Phase 1 of reopening on 11 May, which includes the reopening of barbershops, salons, restaurants, and other businesses.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nPresident Trump recently changed his primary residence from Manhattan to his Mar-a-Lago golf resort, which is located in Palm Beach County.\n\nThe information in the document is attributed to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and was collected on May 12, which means cases were rising even before the county began to reopen on May 11. Other parts of the state had begun to reopen earlier, on May 4.\n\nNeither FEMA nor the DHS responded immediately to a request for comment.\n\nThe DHS document says that San Bernardino County in California \u201a\u00c4\u00fareported an increase of 782 cases in the last 7 days, nearly doubling new cases reported in the previous 7 days. County officials recently began Phase II of the county\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s reopening plan, lifting requirements for mask use on 8 May.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nMarshall County, Ala., the document says, \u201a\u00c4\u00fareported 217 cases in the last 7 days, a 517% increase over the previous 7 days. Marshall County is home to several poultry plants and the meat packing industry accounts for 8% of the county\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s employment. On 11 May, additional businesses were reopened.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nPublic health officials have warned that lifting stay-at-home orders would lead to more infections and, inevitably, more deaths. Some governors have either discounted or dismissed such warnings, as has President Trump.\n\nAscend the Trend Barbershop in Palm Beach is open for business, May 11, 2020. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images) More\n\nEncompassing the beachfront and inland communities north of Miami, Palm Beach County has a population density about four times that of Marshall County, which is in the northeastern corner of Alabama, and seven times that of San Bernardino County, which encompasses the desert region east of Los Angeles. Population density is thought to contribute to the spread of the coronavirus, which causes the lung disease known as COVID-19. That disease has killed more than 87,000 Americans, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\n\nThe coronavirus also tends to strike older people. The average age of a Palm Beach County resident is 45 years old, whereas the average Marshall County resident is 39 years old and the San Bernardino County resident is only 33 years old.\n\nPalm Beach is home to many retirement communities, a fact that worries health officials. The county has recorded 263 coronavirus deaths, three more than the entirety of South Korea, which recorded its first coronavirus case on the same late January day as the United States."

                    "article_content": "It appears as if fact checkers are becoming even more occupied as well as scientists and experts who are scrambling to correct incorrect statements which are naturally being amplified by partisan media, propagandists and some officials globally.\n\nFrom the moment COVID-19 hit some of the global administrations have appeared to be determined to portray an alternate reality around this outbreak. Using some of the incorrect information that has been provided the COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus that is no worse than the seasonal flu, and some of those responses claim that it this a hoax and media coverage of the virus is nothing more than a part of a political conspiracy.\n\nMuch of this messaging and narrative comes from tossed off tweets, impromptu public statements, and public announcements. In reality global health officials are raising growing concerns about the outbreak and efforts to play down COVID-19 which has officially been called a pandemic by W.H.O. To add to the play down efforts they are being greatly amplified by the multi-platform propaganda apparatus that are lobbying for (re)election ranging from administration communications, to keyboard commandos, meme warriors of the internet, prime time partisans, to campaigns running on places such as Facebook. Wherever it may be appearing the overarching false message is still the same: Pay no mind to the fake news and fear mongering about COVID-19 as it is lies and political hype, everything is fine.\n\nAny who choose to open their eyes and actually look for themselves can see the overwhelming truth in plain sight. Actual trained scientists, experts, and fact checkers are desperately scrambling to try and correct misleading information. In America according to the CDC: NO the virus has not been contained, that is an impossible task, NO testing is not widely available to anyone who wants it. Most importantly this is not similar to the common cold or flu meaning most definitely NO people should not go to work or school if they are feeling ill.\n\nBut the misleading responses to the outbreak unfortunately seem to have resonated even in America as a Quinnipiac University poll released this week has found that only 35% of Republicans are concerned about the virus compared to 68% of the Democrats, and it couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be at a worse time as this could help further the spread of COVID-19 rather than slow it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s spread to help containment efforts.\n\nGlobal responses to this outbreak are also drawing some comparisons to that of the autocratic regimes in Iran and China where they tried to deny any issue and tightly control all information of detriment to the local population and watching world. What some administrations are showing is that they don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t need to force silence of actual experts, scientists, and researchers of W.H.O or even the CDC or the press to undermine politically inconvenient information about a public health crisis that is actually true and on a global scale, no they can simply step on a soap box and use a bullhorn to drown out anything true or not.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faTotal containment isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t in the cards, '' said Nancy Messonnier, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. \u201a\u00c4\u00faGiven the nature of this virus and how it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s spreading, that would be impossible. Our goal is to slow this thing down\u201a\u00c4\u00b6 We are preparing as if this were the next pandemic.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nDr. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner, has been warning for months about the possibility of this virus spreading to America. Here is a 6 minute video of an interview where he talks about those who may be more vulnerable, the likely unknown spread, and the current lack of American diagnostic capability: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rel6TDmAnbE \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re just seeing the tip of the iceberg.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nAccording to W.H.O the virus will cause a mild respiratory infection in about 80% of those infected, about half will have pneumonia and another 15% will develop severe illness with at least 5% needing critical care. W.H.O stresses that fundamental public health interventions can still help to limit the spread and drive down cases of transmission even in areas where it is spreading rapidly as the work from authorities in China, Singapore, and South Korea are showing.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is not just a public health crisis, it is a crisis that will touch every sector \u201a\u00c4\u00ee so every sector and every individual must be involved in the fight,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 says W.H.O Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus who said that this is the first coronavirus to reach pandemic levels and also said \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe have never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe cannot say this loudly enough or clearly enough or often enough: All countries can still change the course of this pandemic,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Tedros said Wednesday. 90% of the cumulative cases have been reported in 4 countries is evidence that the rest of the world still had time to prevent an explosion of cases with action.\n\nOfficials from W.H.O. stress that countries should be implementing a strategic combination of containment and mitigation measures that involves trying to detect and stop chains of transmission with isolation and quarantines as well as community level steps such as social distancing to limit the possibility of broad spread from unknown sources that may not be able to be traced or tracked. W.H.O is eminently dismissing questions that efforts such as this are too costly or resources intensive given what could happen if countries do not slow the spread of this disease.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re seeing is successful are the fundamentals of public health,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Maria Van Kerkhove, who heads WHO\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s emerging diseases and zoonoses unit. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBy protecting themselves, they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re preventing the onward transmission, which may lead to another vulnerable person,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 while no one is immune, those who are more vulnerable include older and younger populations and those with existing health issues such as diabetes and heart disease.\n\nMike Ryan, the head of the WHO\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s emergency program admits that public health interventions will not stop the virus dead in its tracks but it will help to slow the spread and flatten the curve to avoid adding burden to an overwhelmed health system.\n\nTedros points to the lack of some countries in resources, capacity and resolve as their officials have been arguing for weeks that some are not moving quickly enough to prepare for an outbreak. While Tendros declined to criticize individual member states publicly, there was note of failures of some countries to trace contacts, communicate clearly, test widely, and failure to coordinate among agencies as well as between federal governments and states, etc.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faYou know who you are,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ryan said about the countries that were not responding adequately.\n\nThis seems to strike home here in the United States where American responses are obviously hampered by more than one of these problems such as most notable the lack of available testing. America, the world is watching and will, no IS documenting accordingly."

                    "article_content": "Carlos Atkins, 27, used to spend weekdays with his 2-year-old son Malachi, taking walks and reading books, before heading out into the night to power wash sidewalks, pick up trash and remove graffiti in downtown Detroit for a local nonprofit. Then the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the city and his son\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s day care center but not Atkins\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 job as an essential worker. After being reassigned to a midday shift that ends at 9 pm, he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s scrambled to find child care, leaning heavily on his mom and aunt.\n\nEven clad in a jumpsuit, gloves and mask, his line of work carries health risks and he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s fearful of bringing home the deadly virus to the two-family flat he shares with his son, mother and younger sister. And, fiercely protective of his young charge, he wonders whether his son should return to day care when Michigan reopens.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s overwhelming. I try not to focus on it,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Atkins says. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI just hope and pray for the best.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nWhat schools will look like when they reopen:Scheduled days home, more online learning, lots of hand-washing\n\nWhen will schools reopen?:Not soon, education leaders say, despite Trump's declarations\n\nThe push to reboot the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s economy is leaving millions of parents like Atkins in a tough bind. They can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t go back to work without someone to care for their children, whether preschools or day care facilities, babysitters or relatives. And, even if they can find child care, they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re worried states are moving too quickly and may be putting their kids\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 lives at risk.\n\nLast week the Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected an extension of the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s stay-at-home order. In some places, employees are being called back to work before child care facilities open.\n\nLack of child care is quickly emerging as one of the biggest barriers to the economy bouncing back, says Patricia Cole, senior director of federal policy for Zero to Three, a nonprofit focused on early childhood development.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faChild care is foundational to our nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ability to recover from this crisis,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Cole said during a news briefing put on by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\nCOVID-19 plunges child care system into crisis\n\nCOVID-19 has plunged the child care industry, 90% of which is privately run, into a crisis the likes of which the nation has never seen.\n\nAlready child care centers were expensive to operate and stayed afloat on meager profits. Caregivers and other staffers, a third of whom have been laid off, often get by on poverty wages and public assistance, unable to afford child care for their own children.\n\nNow child care advocates argue the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s already fragile system is at risk of collapse. They are lobbying for billions more in federal aid to ensure reliable child care is available to parents.\n\nThough in many places they were not required to close, since the pandemic began, nearly half of child care facilities nationwide have shut down, some of them indefinitely as the coronavirus forced families to keep kids at home, according to a survey of child care providers conducted by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC).\n\nSeventeen percent of providers have closed to everyone except the children of essential personnel. Of the facilities which have remained open, 85% are operating at less than 50% of enrollment capacity and the majority of those are operating at less than 25% of capacity, the survey conducted in April found.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe don't fully know yet who are the child care providers and facilities that are not going to have survived this economic crisis because they just couldn't keep the doors open,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 says Javaid Siddiqi, CEO of The Hunt Institute, an education nonprofit in Cary, North Carolina.\n\nIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s also unclear how many providers will be able to afford to reopen or at what capacity with strict new health protocols that vary from state to state. Some new rules limit the number of children that can be in any group \u201a\u00c4\u00ec and in many cases require the same children and adults be placed together every day. Child care centers also face higher costs for additional staffing, personal protective equipment, hand sanitizer and cleaning supplies.\n\nSummer camps and programs have also fallen on hard times and are being driven out of business. The ones still standing are trying to figure out if or how they can reopen safely.\n\nHalf of facilities closed, remaining providers stretched\n\nChild care providers that have remained open to watch over the children of essential workers are stretched to the breaking point.\n\nCrystal Perry-Grant, a 38-year-old mother of three, runs a family day care in Perris, California, a small city in Riverside County. For 12-hour stretches with the help of her 17-year-old daughter, she cares for eight children whose parents are essential workers from firefighters to UPS workers, ranging in age from 1 to 9.\n\nSchool-age kids learn remotely on six computers that routinely slow her Wi-Fi to a crawl. She cooks homemade soups from fresh farm produce to boost their immune systems. Hand sanitizer squirted liberally throughout the day into little palms has kept sickness at bay. In the past two months, she hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t had even a single runny nose.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faOur parents need us. They don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have family around. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a dire need. I would feel bad if I closed,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Perry-Grant says. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNo one had a job they could up and quit, so I couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t either.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBut Perry-Grant can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t take on any more children. She has no openings and a long waiting list.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThis goes very much to the heart of whether we are going to be able to just reopen the economy,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 says Michael Madowitz, an economist at the Center for American Progress who studies the child care industry. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThere are a lot of reasons why we can't just flip a switch and this is very high on the list.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nFor Demetriss \u201a\u00c4\u00faDemi\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 DeShazior, a 41-year-old medical assistant in Miami, child care tops her list of concerns.\n\nHer mother babysat her 2-year-old while DeShazior languished on a long waiting list for partially subsidized child care. When she was seven months pregnant, DeShazior learned she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d secured a spot, but this was a month before the pandemic hit. Before she could finish filling out the paperwork, child care facilities closed.\n\nSo DeShazior took family medical leave earlier than she planned in March to stay home with her son. Now she's applying for child care for her toddler and 5-week-old as an essential health worker but her unease is growing.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIf I do return to work, will my babies be safe from contracting COVID-19 at day care?\" DeShazior wonders. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWill I even have day care covered for both babies by my return date?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nNation cannot reopen with kids still at home\n\nEven before the coronavirus tore across the country, parents scrambled to find child care. With too few spots to meet demand, the burden fell heaviest on low-wage parents, women and families of color. Now millions more spots may have evaporated.\n\nTraditional backstops such as grandparents who used to step in to care for children while parents worked belong to populations most vulnerable to the coronavirus.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faMost states are talking about child care, but there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a mixed bag in terms of how many are actually being planful about it. When you as a state say, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re open,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 but then you don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t give guidance around child care, that puts the burden of the situation on families,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 says NAEYC's CEO Rhian Evans Allvin. And that, Allvin, says, \u201a\u00c4\u00faexacerbates the already existing inequities in early childhood education because inherently wealthier families have more options.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nAs more parents prepare to return to work, the enormousness of the challenge facing the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s patchwork child care system is staggering.\n\nFour in 10 working adults have children under 18. Nearly 60% of children under 5 participated in regular weekly care arrangements and a third were enrolled in a child care program of some kind before the coronavirus struck. Yet, with many child care providers from small family day cares to after-school programs closing up shop indefinitely, parents are at loose ends.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faParents who are being called back into work at this point really may find challenges in securing care or even, in some cases, securing the care they were accustomed to,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 says Dan Wuori, director of early learning at The Hunt Institute, which has a database tracking state child care policies.\n\nAmong those parents is Laura Byrd, 35, a human resources generalist from Newark, New Jersey and mother of a 7-year-old who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s been working from home since the start of the pandemic.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faOur \u201a\u00c4\u00f2new normal\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 will pose some difficulties once I am instructed to return to the office. As the state reopens, our day care centers and summer camps will not be operating which will create child care issues for me,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 says Byrd, who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s considering taking a leave of absence if necessary.\n\nAgonizing choices between health risks and paychecks\n\nReopening is forcing parents in Georgia, Florida and other states into an agonizing choice between potentially risking their health and the health of their children and earning a paycheck.\n\nLate at night and in the early morning hours, Christy Moreno, 39, a bilingual editorial director, squeezes a stress ball while sending work emails from her Kansas City, Missouri, home.\n\nHer makeshift office is a small round table in the corner of her dining room covered in stray crayons and device chargers. This single mother of two, ages 10 and 13, balances overseeing her children\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s education and counseling Latino parents working in hotels and restaurants on how to find child care. On social media, parent groups are overflowing with worry and confusion: What are families supposed to do?\n\nAnxieties are running especially high for parents whose children have health conditions that put them at higher risk for the coronavirus. Many can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t afford lower-risk options such as babysitters and nannies or having one parent stay home. These parents say even if they can find child care, they don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know if they should send their kids. Some employees can take sick leave or expanded family and medical leave if they are caring for a child when schools and day care centers are closed under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which was signed into law in March, but not everyone has that option.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faParents are being forced into this Catch-22,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 says Keri Rodrigues, founding president of the National Parents Union, a network of parent organizations across the country. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThey feel a desperate need to go back to work but at the same time they are terrified of this deadly virus.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nParents worry: Is it safe to send kids back to child care?\n\nLaid off in March, Rachel Jean-Pierre is a single mother of two in Union, New Jersey. If she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s called back to her job in New York City as a guest service manager in July, she will have to find a family member to help care for her children, ages 6 and 9, both of whom have asthma.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWith the government reopening the economy with no confirmed solution to this pandemic, I am torn between wanting my children to return to their normal schedules and wanting to keep them safe,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she says. \u201a\u00c4\u00faUntil the country has really grabbed hold of this pandemic, as a parent with children who suffer from asthma, I would rather be safe than sorry.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nConflicting messages have not helped parents make these tough calls. While President Donald Trump pushes governors to work to reopen schools, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned in Senate testimony last week, \"We don't know everything about this virus and we really better be pretty careful, particularly when it comes to children.\"\n\nIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s week 11 of quarantine for Naomi Nedd, a 49-year-old mother and contract negotiator for a managed care plan in Queens. She\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s resorted to bribing her 3-year-old son with gummy bears and screen time when she has to write a contract or jump on a Zoom call. Once he falls asleep at 7:30 pm, she digs in for hours to make a dent in her workload.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI went into this thinking, my kid is home, it will be fine. But it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s so different when you are trying to be the professional you are when you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve left your child at day care than when you are at a dining room table with a 3-year-old who just knows you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re mommy,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Nedd says.\n\nHer son is supposed to start a summer program in July and preschool in the fall, but her heart races just thinking about it. The ravages of the coronavirus are all around her at the epicenter of the New York outbreak. Children her son\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s age don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know how to socially distance.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI don't care what opens up, if my gut feels like it isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t safe, we will have to figure out a way to continue to make it work at home,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Nedd says.\n\nIn Boston, Yahaira Lopez, a 41-year-old mother of 10-year-old twins, one with ADHD, the other with autism, was recently laid off from her job on a mobile crisis team performing mental health risk assessments. She\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s struggling to be a substitute teacher to her two fourth graders, run Autism Sprinter, her nonprofit that helps the families and caregivers of children who are on the spectrum, and figure out how she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll afford rent and utilities.\n\nSchools are closed, summer programs are up in the air and Massachusetts has not yet reopened child care centers, she says. Even when these programs restart, Lopez says she\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not sure she will send her kids. Both of her sons have severe asthma.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI would probably be very scared to send my children to any form of child care or after school program,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she says, \u201a\u00c4\u00faor, to be honest with you, even back to school into what may be overcrowded classrooms.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9"

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) took to Twitter Monday to explain in clear terms to a liberal commentator why the \u201a\u00c4\u00faObamagate\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 scandal is such a huge deal.\n\nGabriel Sherman, an opinion writer for the left-wing magazine Vanity Fair, was apparently confused about what conservatives find to be unseemly about the Obama administration\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unmasking of American citizens, including retired Gen. Michael Flynn, in December 2016. Flynn, who was tapped to be President Donald Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s first national security adviser, was surveilled in conversation with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faSerious questions for Trumpers,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sherman wrote on Twitter last Friday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat is the scandal of unmasking an American official caught on an intercept discussing US sanctions policy with Ambassador of a hostile foreign country that had just launched a massive cyber attack on our election?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nUhh, he was the incoming National Security Advisor & a 3-star general. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s SUPPOSED to discuss sanctions policy. That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s his job. The unmasking was part of outgoing admin launching a massive sting operation to try to entrap him.

                    "article_content": "Brazilian government warned on May 22 that national security would be at risk if investigators granted a request to seize the cell phone of President Jair Bolsonaro. Opposition parties have requested the phone of far-right leader and his son Carlos to probe into the allegations levelled by former justice minister Sergio Moro that Bolsonaro tried to interfere in federal police investigations.\n\nA video of a cabinet meeting has been released on the order of Supreme Court justice in which the Brazilian President was seen using profane words to express his frustration at his inability to extract information from police. In the video, Bolsonaro can be heard vowing to change Cabinet ministers if it is needed to protect his family from the \u201a\u00c4\u00fafarce\u201a\u00c4\u00f9.\n\nMoro, one of the most popular figures in Bolsonaro administration, resigned last month after the Brazilian President fired the federal police director-general without consulting the Justice Minister. He alleged that Bolsonaro openly demanded changes in key federal police positions, including agency\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s chief.\n\nThe video was the latest blow to Bolsonaro\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s popularity which has nosedived after the coronavirus pandemic. Brazil has reported over 330,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases with more than 21,000 deaths related to the virus and is all set to topple Russia from the second position worldwide.\n\nRead: Man Accidentally Appears Naked During Zoom Conference Call With Bolsonaro\n\nOver 5.2 million cases\n\nAccording to the latest data of John Hopkins University, over 5.2 million coronavirus cases have been confirmed across the globe with over 338,000 deaths, overwhelming health care facilities worldwide. The United States, Russia, Brazil, and the UK are the worst-hit countries due to the pandemic with around 60 per cent of death toll reported from these four countries alone.\n\nThe numbers get more sombre for the US as it has reported over 1.6 million cases, almost one-third of the worldwide cases, and more than 96,000 deaths due to the infectious disease. Within the United States, New York has reported over one-fourth of the nationwide coronavirus cases and almost one-tenth of the worldwide cases.\n\nRead: COVID-19: Bolsonaro Says Brazil To Sign New Protocol Recommending Use Of Chloroquine\n\n(Image credit: AP)"

                    "article_content": "Original article written by Bill Sardi can be viewed on LewRockwell.com; the following is an excerpt which represents the author's opinion and does not necessarily reflect those of WHN:\n\nI penned a prior report, extrapolating from published flu studies, which predicts that 6/10ths-to-1.3% serious side effects after mandated coronavirus vaccination among the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 72.6 million senior adults would hospitalize 435,000-943,000 and a subsequent 1.4% mortality rate would then result in 54,202-111,493 deaths.\n\nThese hospitalizations and deaths are not necessarily caused by a vaccine, which is always pre-tested for safety among healthy adults who DO respond to vaccination by making antibodies, but from weak immunity among certain known risk groups.\n\nHere are four ways the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic could have already been brought to a \u201a\u00c4\u00fadead stop.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n1. Coronaviruses produce seasonal disease, running 5 months from November to the end of March. This is the period when the earth tilts away from the sun in northern latitudes resulting in less vitamin D production in human skin combined with colder weather that causes people to bundle up in clothing, which makes things worse. And what do health authorities demand the public do? Stay indoors under quarantine and prolong the agony of this unprecedented pandemic.\n\nIf you haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t noticed, quarantines don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t work. Look at the data from Italy (\u201a\u00c4\u00faAll of Italy Is In Lockdown As Coronavirus Cases Rise\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec CNN)\n\nAmericans must defy health authorities and go outside and bask in mid-day (10 AM to 2 PM) sunshine with skin exposed. Some of the news media ridicules individuals who ignore orders to stay indoors, inciting fear by reporting death counts that are only normal for the season and may not even be caused by coronavirus. ( NOTE: WHN is not recommending breaking any orders, and it is possible to stay inside and open a window/door to bask in the sun.)\n\nOnly a few infectious disease investigators have noted climatic conditions (cold temperature) drives people indoors (as do quarantines) that not only reduce vitamin D blood levels but also increase disease severity.\n\nCoronaviruses are believed to be in circulation through the rest of the year but sunshine vitamin D keeps them from erupting. The man who is running the CDC, keeps pushing for prolongation of the quarantine/lockdown that is literally priming the disease. That same man said, before Congress, Covid-19 coronavirus is \u201a\u00c4\u00fa10 times more lethal than seasonal flu.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 But was quoted four days later in the New England Journal of Medicine to say \u201a\u00c4\u00fathe case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1%\u201a\u00c4\u00b6.. and may be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nForcing people indoors increases transmission of seasonal viruses by 18.7 times compared to open-air environments. This information is contained in a report issued by the CDC itself [Emerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 26, June 2020]. Obviously, the left hand doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know what the right hand is doing at the CDC.\n\nWhile the world awaits a coronavirus vaccine, vitamin D is many times more effective than the flu vaccine. These discoveries have not been embraced by public health authorities.\n\nThere is also strong evidence that many virally-infected patients also have tuberculosis, particularly in foreign-born immigrants. TB is also a seasonal lung infection, like cold and flu viruses (i.e. coronavirus). Vitamin D is a known antidote for TB.\n\nGiven that coronavirus infection threatens high-risk individuals, a more targeted vitamin D supplementation campaign among diabetics, obese individuals, tobacco smokers and alcohol imbibers would likely serve to reduce cases of infection as well as subsequent hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nIt would cost society far less to target high-risk groups with the provision of vitamin D supplements and even sun lamp therapy than it would to vaccinate masses of people who will never be infected or hospitalized.\n\nPharmacies seeing patients who fit high-risk criteria could hand out free bottles of vitamin D provided by the government or at least recommend vitamin D to every patient.\n\nVaccines aren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t reliable prevention for high-risk individuals who don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t efficiently produce antibodies. Vitamin D therapy would represent true prevention. The Centers for Disease Control purchases vaccines from pharmaceutical manufacturers and could do the same for vitamin D. Of course, this would be anathema to physicians. Dispensing from pharmacies would likely be more do-able.\n\nInfluenza costs ~$10.4 billion a year for hospitalizations, doctor visits, vaccines and medicines. The provision of vitamin D pills during the 5 months of the cold and flu season for the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 12 million senior adults aged 80+, considered the highest risk group, would cost just ~$200 million and would likely prevent billions of dollars of disease and death.\n\n2. According to various reports, about 2-in-10 to 3-in-10 of coronavirus cases occur among health care and hospital personnel. The Centers for Disease Control does recommend healthcare personnel be provided respirators or masks. But after many years of drafting plans to fight seasonal flu outbreaks and epidemics, the CDC was caught unprepared. Masks and respirators are in short supply. What is needed are N-95 (0.3-micron filter) respirators, which are not available.\n\nAn alternative would be to use N95 respirators and N95 masks intended for industrial purposes, which are available, and adapt them for medical use.\n\nHere the nation is 3 months into its battle against seasonal flu and COVID-19 coronavirus, and it is just now figuring out how to supply n95 masks and respirators to healthcare personnel. Be aware, some studies show N95 respirators compared to N95 masks reduce illness from 17% to just 6.2%. However, this was for transmission of bacteria, not viruses like coronavirus. However, as stated by Dr. Lawrence Broxmeyer, a great deal of the infectious lung disease now being treated is caused by a bacterium \u201a\u00c4\u00ec tuberculosis.\n\nIf the public health agencies and hospitals can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t provide ambulance paramedics, nurses and ancillary health personnel proper protection, maybe we need crowdfunding by the public to buy them N95 respirators, so in case we do have to go to the hospital, we don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have the disease transmitted from doctor/nurse to patient.\n\n3. The lack of any approved drug or vaccine for coronavirus has prompted the search for natural non-prescription remedies. The trace mineral zinc is one of the natural remedies that have been revealed in this coronavirus pandemic as an antidote to coronavirus infection.\n\nIt has been demonstrated that the trace mineral zinc inhibits the replication of coronavirus in infected cells via its ability to block RNA synthesis. Coronaviruses are RNA viruses.\n\nDrugs that improve zinc utilization and facilitate zinc entry in cells, such as chloroquine, have now become well known for their ability to quell coronavirus infections. To prove the underlying mechanism that makes this drug work, chelation (removal) of zinc reverses this effect.\n\nThe President of the United States declared chloroquine, used to treat malaria, a \u201a\u00c4\u00fagodsend,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 which was quickly pounced upon by political opponents and given widespread news coverage. But the FDA just now issued emergency approval of chloroquine for coronavirus.\n\nQuercetin, an extract from red apples, and EGCG from green tea are also zinc ionophores (binders) like chloroquine.\n\nFew physicians realize that unbound (free) bioavailable zinc is kept at a low level by binding to its carrier (metallothionein). The trace mineral selenium induces release of zinc from its binder, facilitating more bioavailable zinc.\n\nIf the public catches on, zinc could replace vaccines.\n\n4. Diligent physicians who treat volumes of patients can accelerate research as there is no time to wait for results from clinical trials. There is no time for peer review. To avoid needless deaths, real-time work-in-progress studies can fast-track clinical data needed by medical personnel worldwide.\n\nOne such example is that of Vladimir Zelenko in New York who reports an unusually high coronavirus infection rate of 65% among the first 200 patients tested. The successful use of the therapeutic triad of an antibiotic (azithromycin), an autoimmune drug (hydroxychloroquine) and zinc sulfate among 699 infected patients has resulted in zero deaths, zero need for respirators with just 4 patients admitted to the hospital; in other words, zero death rate. Of note, both azithromycin and chloroquine are used to treat tuberculosis.\n\nNotice the central role zinc is playing in the prevention and treatment of coronavirus. Zinc has only come out of the closet as a last resort. Yet it has been available for decades. Studies involving zinc lozenges have produced mixed results, but it has been noted that only zinc acetate lozenges that deliver a given amount of zinc have been found effective. Most zinc lozenges on the market do not deliver sufficient dosage to quell a viral infection. About 75-92 milligrams a day has been shown to be effective when given in a slow-release lozenge.\n\nIt is difficult to come to any other conclusion than that public health agencies aren't exactly operating in the public\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s best interest. In fact, either by issuance of bad policies and health edicts or neglect of less problematic and more economical remedies, Americans can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t rely on public health agencies for the best advice on how to avoid or treat coronavirus infections.\n\nGiven that the news media parrots health policies to the public without question says Americans are being delivered nothing but high-end propaganda and need to obtain health information from other sources. Don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t listen to politicians who complain about a lack of hospital ventilators. According to one emergency room physician, 70-90% of virally infected patients with pneumonia that are placed on ventilators die. Ventilators are a last-ditch effort to buy time and hope for a cure. Americans will have to cure the coronavirus epidemic on their own.\n\nFear will be played to the hilt now to coerce the population into forced vaccination and 100% monitoring of our whereabouts, which was the objective of the plannedemic from the beginning. Because fear trumps information and logic."

                    "article_content": "Advertisement\n\nAs a first-time mother with no idea what to expect, Nancy Pedroza was convinced the hospital was the safest place to have her baby.\n\nThat conviction turned to doubt when in late March most U.S. states ordered residents to stay home and hospitals and doctors began taking new precautions to protect pregnant women and their babies against the novel coronavirus sweeping the nation.\n\nPedroza holds on to Morgan as she experiences contractions while taking a brisk walk with Nichollette Jones, her doula, to speed up Pedroza's contractions. So, at 40 weeks pregnant, she turned to a midwife to help her have a home birth. She and her partner Ryan Morgan were about to become parents in the middle of a pandemic. \"Thing were changing so fast,\" said Pedroza, 27, who lives with her partner at her parents' house in Fort Worth, Texas. She had to go alone to all her visits with her obstetrician where before she had brought either Morgan, her father or a doula, a birth assistant.\n\nPedroza lies on a bed in front of Jones, Taylor and Morgan as he helps to pump her breastmilk to try and speed up her contractions. But what really scared her was the uncertainty of who would be allowed to stand by her side at the hospital when the baby came into the world. She would have to choose between Morgan and her doula. The hospital would allow only one and warned her the policy could change and it might bar all visitors. \"It was scary to feel like I might have to do it alone,\" she said, noting that the doctors and nurses were not the same as those who had supported her throughout her pregnancy. \"It's nothing like having someone there that you care about and cares about you that's willing to hold your hand and tell you this is going to be OK.\"\n\nPedroza attends an appointment with her licensed midwives Susan Taylor who checks her stomach, and Amanda Prouty in Taylor's home office at her house. As COVID-19 puts the globe on pause and changes every aspect of daily life, women are entering motherhood with a mixture of anxiety, fear and frustration. Some countries, although not the United States, have banned everyone from the delivery room. Others are separating women who become sick from their newborns. By early April, with her baby past due and learning Medicaid would not cover a home birth, Pedroza considered giving birth at home without any medical assistance.\n\nPedroza experiences contractions. She got in touch with midwife Susan Taylor on Facebook, who not only lowered her fee but offered up her own home when Pedroza's mother became uneasy about the idea of her grandchild being born in her bathroom or bedroom. But Pedroza was running out of time. Legally the midwife had to transfer Pedroza's care to a hospital if she went past 42 weeks of pregnancy. A sonogram showed the baby's fluid levels were low, which can cause complications during birth.\n\nPedroza is supported by Jones and Morgan as she experiences contractions while laboring. After a membrane sweep, visit to a chiropractor, a brisk walk and using a breast pump to stimulate labor, the contractions started. After laboring several hours in a birthing tub in Taylor's home, Pedroza started pushing but the baby's heart rate suddenly dropped from 130 to 30, so the midwives called an ambulance.\n\nPedroza experiences contractions as she is placed onto an ambulance stretcher to be taken to hospital by paramedics. Masked emergency workers put Pedroza onto a stretcher and wheeled her to an ambulance that took her and Morgan to Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Southwest around 1 a.m. Taylor rode with her in the ambulance, monitoring the baby's heartbeat.\n\nPedroza is carried into an ambulance on a stretcher, to be taken to hospital. But once at the hospital, her midwives had to leave. \"Once I got the epidural administered and calmed me down a little bit and realizing I'd still be able to do this myself without possibly having a C-section and hearing the baby's heartbeat on the monitor it brought me so much comfort that I didn't care I was at the hospital at that point,\" said Pedroza, who worked as a massage therapist before becoming pregnant.\n\nProuty watches 2-day old footage of the birth of Kai Rohan Morgan, recorded by his father Ryan, of Pedroza giving birth. After laboring with a mask on for hours, at 5:55 a.m. on April 8 a healthy baby boy named Kai Rohan Morgan was born, weighing 8 pounds and 5 ounces. The hospital gave her and Morgan masks to wear anytime someone entered their room. Some staff also wore masks and gloves when they helped with breast feeding and took their vital signs.\n\nTaylor takes two-day old Kai's temperature while checking if he has tongue tie, an oral condition that can potentially cause issues with feeding, during a newborn screening at the house of Kai's maternal grandparents.\n\nStory \"It's already kind of scary thinking that it's a possibility that you're going to be in an environment that is contaminated or that puts you at risk or your baby at risk,\" Pedroza said. \"What puts me on edge more is seeing everyone with that attire and being very adamant about wearing it.\""

                    "article_content": "Covid-19 coronavirus temperature limits: Climate does not matter\n\nScientists from the University of Hong Kong have found at which temperatures the novel coronavirus remains most and least active. According to them, the virus remains highly stable for a long time at a temperature of about +4 degrees Celsius. In the absence of disinfection, its activity begins to decline only after 14 days.\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 is very sensitive to high temperatures: it dies within five minutes at +70 \u00ac\u221eC. At +56 \u00ac\u221e C, the virus remains active for less than half an hour, at +37 degrees - for no more than two days, and at a temperature of 22 degrees - for about a week.\n\nScientists find how long coronavirus can live on various surfaces\n\nOn the outer side of medical masks the virus lives for at least a week at room temperature and relative humidity of 65 percent. Coronavirus stays on paper for less than three hours, on wooden surfaces and fabrics - for not more than two days, on glass - for less than four days, on stainless steel and plastic - for no longer than a week.\n\n\n\nIt is worthy of note that reusable face masks made of fabric, which many people tend to use nowadays instead of disposable medical masks (or due to the shortage of them) can be used repeatedly only after meticulous disinfection. As with disposable medical masks, cloth masks need to be changed every two to three hours of constant use.\n\nAt home, cloth masks need to be washed with soap or detergent and then treated with a steam generator or steam iron.\n\nAfter disinfection, one should press the mask with hot iron without steaming it to kill all the germs that can live in moist fabric.\n\nAs medical specialists all over the world emphasize, such masks are intended primarily for sick individuals in the first place. They can be effective only in combination with other prophylactic measures (avoiding contact, frequent washing of hands, disinfection of items and surfaces, etc.). In addition, the mask should be worn by people who provide medical care for sick individuals.\n\n\n\nHealthy people can wear the mask when visiting public places, using public transport, but the effectiveness of the mask in such situations has not been proven. Disposable medical masks made of non-woven material should not be reused or disinfected.\n\nCoronavirus pandemic to end this summer?\n\nSpecialists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that 90% of cases of COVID-19 infection occurred at temperatures ranging from 3 to 17\u00ac\u221eC and absolute humidity from 4 to 9 g/m\u00ac\u2265. If their assumption is correct, warm and humid weather in the coming months may improve the situation in many countries of the Northern Hemisphere, whereas the situation in the countries of the Southern Hemisphere may worsen. However, this does not mean that coronavirus will not spread in countries with warm and humid climate.\n\n\n\nFor example, in Thailand, where temperatures remain at about 30 degrees Centigrade all the year round, coronavirus remains active and tough measures to combat it. At the same time, the novel virus is now actively spreading in Syria and turkey, where temperatures already near +25C. Some specialists believe that climate shows no influence on the new coronavirus as it has spread on all continents, except Antarctica. This is just an observation as there is still no scientific base to explain the nature of the new coronavirus."

                    "article_content": "Transforming America into a country that runs on clean energy is one way experts hope to alleviate the devastating economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. With unemployment soaring and oil prices in a free fall, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s looking highly unlikely that the US will simply step back into \u201a\u00c4\u00fabusiness as usual.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Even though the pandemic is still raging, policy experts, climate action advocates, and scientists have all started drawing up plans that could save Americans from both the ravages of climate change and the economic fallout of COVID-19.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faRight now is the ideal time to be investing in renewable energy\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faRight now is the ideal time to be investing in renewable energy that can produce millions of family-sustaining wage jobs across the United States,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 says Mark Paul, a political economist at New College of Florida.\n\nPaul is one of the co-authors of a $2 trillion \u201a\u00c4\u00fagreen stimulus\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 that aims to create millions of jobs by dramatically expanding renewable energy capacity and retooling the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s infrastructure for the transition away from fossil fuels. Smaller plans have also grown at state and local levels. A petition coming out of New York asks for $500 billion to help states with budget shortfalls and expand clean energy.\n\nThe basic idea is that federal spending on a cleaner future would put Americans back to work, shift the balance of power away from polluting industries with big lobbying budgets, and meet key deadlines for climate action that scientists say are necessary to limit the damage done by climate change.\n\nRenewables like solar and wind create more jobs per unit of energy delivered than coal or natural gas, a 2010 study published in the journal Energy Policy found. While $1 million in stimulus spending on oil and natural gas generated roughly five jobs, the same amount would result in 13 to 14 jobs in wind and solar, a 2009 report found.\n\nsolar and wind create more jobs per unit of energy delivered than coal or natural gas\n\nThose numbers were crunched as the policymakers tried to figure out how to rebound from a different economic crisis \u201a\u00c4\u00ee the 2008 Great Recession. Paul says one lesson learned from the Great Recession is that it isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t too early to start planning ahead. After all, the climate crisis is expected to take its own toll on the global economy. Weaning the planet off the fossil fuels that are heating it up could help nip that financial crisis in the bud.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe biggest challenge for COVID now will be managing the return to work, but then having work to go back to that opens up real opportunities \u201a\u00c4\u00ee and that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s what this clean energy investment would do,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 says Daniel Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley and a co-author of the green stimulus proposal and the 2010 paper in Energy Policy.\n\nThe threats posed by climate change make the transition to renewables more urgent than ever. As technology advanced and the cost of making and installing solar panels has dropped, renewable energy became a bigger part of the US energy mix. The Obama-era stimulus package that included a $90 billion investment in clean energy also gave the industry a boost over the past decade.\n\nYet despite expanding rapidly since 2008, renewables still only made up 11 percent of US energy consumption in 2018. That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not nearly enough if the US wants to meet the targets laid out in the Paris Agreement that scientists say are necessary to avoid catastrophic effects of climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels need to be cut nearly in half from 2010 levels by 2030, according to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nTo tackle the climate crisis, we need to clean up our energy system over the next 15 years. The narwhal curve shows us the challenge\u201a\u00c4\u00eeand the opportunity.\n\n\n\nThrilled to share this video based on my new book, Short Circuiting Policy.pic.twitter.com/vcS9hpKvVm \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Leah Stokes (@leahstokes) April 27, 2020\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are not moving fast enough on renewable energy and the stimulus is an amazing opportunity to move faster,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Leah Stokes, an assistant professor at UC Santa Barbara and author of the new book, Short Circuiting Policy: Interest Groups and the Battle Over Clean Energy and Climate Policy in the American States. If the US powers its electricity and transportation sectors entirely with renewables, that would slash its carbon emissions by more than half, Stokes proposes.\n\nJobs wouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t just come from building new solar and wind farms. To support the influx of energy from renewables, the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s energy grid would need to grow twice as large, she says. America\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s grid was built to support fossil fuels; power is generated at centralized locations and then travels long distances over transmission lines to power peoples\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 homes and businesses. Renewable energy generation, on the other hand, is distributed more widely. There\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s also the issue of intermittency: the amount of energy coming into the grid from wind and solar farms across the US can vary with the weather. So an updated and expanded grid needs to be able to get excess renewable energy generated in one location to other places that need it.\n\nGetting all of that done is a massive undertaking that would require a lot of boots on the ground. Paul argues that clean energy can offer a new career path for many of the millions of people who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve lost their jobs recently. The distributed nature of renewables also means they have the potential to employ people locally across all 50 states, rather than tying jobs to regions with rich oil, gas, or coal deposits.\n\nThe number of jobs in solar and wind are expected to grow rapidly through 2028, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Solar panel system installers and wind turbine technicians are the fastest growing occupations in the country. The number of people in each occupation was expected to climb by 63 percent and 57 percent respectively by 2028, but that was before the pandemic hit. Now, the industry will need some support from governments to keep that momentum going.\n\nNew York state, despite being the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic in the US, is still betting on renewables to help it recover from the pandemic and avert more crises caused by climate change. In April, it passed a measure to speed up the siting process for new renewable energy projects as part of its 2020-2021 budget, even as other budget items fell by the wayside because of the economic crunch caused by the virus.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faKeeping us on track [for climate targets] will be a driver of construction jobs. It will be an opportunity to help the broader state economy get back on track with what was already a fast growing sector,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 says Alicia Barton, president and CEO of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHopefully if we can think smartly about things the state can do and potentially see investments from the federal government, we have a good opportunity to seize a challenging moment and turn it into a moment of opportunity.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faKeeping us on track [for climate targets] will be a driver of construction jobs.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nWhile there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s opportunity, there are also significant roadblocks. States like New York, which already had ambitious plans to scale up renewable energy but was also hard hit by the pandemic, shed thousands of clean energy jobs since the pandemic started. Projects are languishing during stay-at-home orders. More than half of American solar workers were either laid off or faced cutbacks, according to an April survey by the Solar Energy Industries Association. Thirty-five thousand jobs and $35 billion in investments in wind energy are jeopardized by the COVID-19 pandemic, the American Wind Energy Association reports.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unfortunately safe to say that we are going to be headed into a pretty deep economic downturn, even when our economies slowly open up,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 says Noah Kaufman, a researcher at Columbia University. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThese are things that are going to be very bad for all industries including the renewable industry. Spending is going to be down; it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll be harder to get financing.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe best thing that the government can do for the economy is work to rev the economy back up to full speed as quickly as possible through deficit spending,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Paul says. Skeptics of proposals like a Green New Deal have balked at the price tag of retooling the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s energy infrastructure. But the economic disaster following the pandemic has squashed much of the political aversion to deficit spending \u201a\u00c4\u00ee the question now is how to spend that money.\n\nmore hurdles for clean energy growth\n\nThe question of how to best spend deficit money will be hashed out by politicians, and that presents even more hurdles for continued clean energy growth. Renewable industries\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 asks of the federal government have so far been pretty modest. They\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve pushed for an extension of tax credits that expire this year, which they could miss out on as projects are stalled. Republicans and fossil fuel lobbyists have sought to block even that, as the Trump administration has prioritized boosting coal, oil, and natural gas.\n\nAnd while states, cities, and the private sector had stepped up to cut their greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re now tightening purse strings \u201a\u00c4\u00ee which could stymie renewable energy growth and other efforts to take action on climate change.\n\nTo top it all off, the $2 trillion green stimulus proposed by Paul and others patches together policy recommendations from Democratic candidates who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve dropped from the presidential race \u201a\u00c4\u00ee so it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unlikely that the proposal will pick up enough steam at the federal level to be put in action while Republicans are in charge. A lot will ride on the outcome of November elections.\n\nIf the plan did actually become reality, it would be more of an extended recovery plan instead of a quick injection of money. Paul and others who crafted the proposal write that their $2 trillion plan \u201a\u00c4\u00fafocuses on the longer-term challenge of jumpstarting economic recovery and transitioning to a more sustainable economy.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBut in an economic emergency like this one, speed does need to play a role. Even with the long-term goal of decarbonization, a stimulus needs to quickly put money in the hands of people who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll spend it, Kaufman explains. That ought to inform what kinds of energy and infrastructure projects should move forward as part of any kind of plan to boost the economy.\n\nBuilding a high-speed renewable-energy rail line across the country, for example, could create jobs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation \u201a\u00c4\u00ee but it could also get mired in permitting and legal issues for years. On the other hand, grants or subsidies for shovel-ready solar and wind projects and funding for energy-efficiency retrofits would get federal dollars to people much faster. More localized renewable energy projects are also quicker to get off the ground, in general, than new oil and gas infrastructure like pipelines that cross state borders and often get held up in court for years, Kammen at Berkeley says.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faClean energy really has a leg up, certainly over dirty energy.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBeyond getting people back to work, clean energy spending solves other problems. It would curb air pollution that burdened certain communities with more preexisting health conditions and made them particularly vulnerable to the novel coronavirus. And by cutting out fossil fuels, the US avoids scenarios where the climate crisis could cost the US economy hundreds of billions of dollars each year by 2090. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt would be silly to design a stimulus package and not also try to have the spending lead to long term benefits. All else equal, you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d much rather build a bridge than have people dig ditches and then fill them in again,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Kaufman adds. \u201a\u00c4\u00faFrom that regard, I think, clean energy really has a leg up, certainly over dirty energy.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis can be looked at as a canary in the coal mine, says Eric Orts, professor at Wharton and director of the business school\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Initiative for Global Environmental Leadership. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOne thing we can do is learn from this so that with respect to climate change we don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t do the same thing that we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve just done with respect to the coronavirus, which is fail to listen to the scientists, fail to change, fail to get ready.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9"

We are thinking of you and your families every single day.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe county also announced 1,204 new cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, bringing the total number of infections so far to 42,307.\n\nThe mid-day total did not include updated numbers for Pasadena and Long Beach. Both cities have their own health departments, unlike every other city in the county, and have been managing their own local response to COVID-19. Long Beach reported three new deaths, bringing the city\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s total to 68, and 95 new cases for a total of 1,495. Pasadena reported six new cases, for a total of 790 and two new deaths, for a total of 79.\n\nOf the newly reported deaths in LA County, 28 were over the age of 65, 20 of whom had underlying health conditions; 12 were between the ages of 41 and 65, 10 of whom had underlying health conditions.

The transmission rate has declined from one person with the virus infecting about three other people to one person with the virus infecting one other person on average, she said.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is very good news, and it shows that what we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re doing over past few weeks \u201a\u00c4\u00ee staying home, physical distancing, wearing our cloth face coverings \u201a\u00c4\u00ee has resulted in a reduced number of infections from what we would have had had we not taken any action.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe average number of deaths per day is also shrinking, and officials are meeting their target for contact tracing, which is to follow up with every new case within one day of receiving that information, Ferrer said.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faAs a community, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve done this together,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said, \u201a\u00c4\u00faand this progress is a direct reflection of what all of you in your day-to-day lives have been able to accomplish.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nMoving forward, she said, it will be important for people to continue taking those precautions as they take advantage of opportunities to get outside.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faAs we hike our trails, go to our beaches and use our other outdoor spaces, we can all take responsibility for creating safety for the people who work at those sites and others who are using these spaces,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI know we can do this.

We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve discovered that while it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s clearly not for everyone, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not so bad.\n\nTrending: After \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Suffering In Hell\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 During His COVID Treatment Coma, Drummer Rejects Satanic Beliefs\n\nWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve seen actual innovation, though. Just a couple of examples include the doctors in Oregon who created a 3D printed ventilator for $10 and an app that helps with \u201a\u00c4\u00fasocial distancing\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 by limiting the number of customers in stores by creating \u201a\u00c4\u00favirtual queues.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a win-win for businesses and consumers.\n\nBut some \u201a\u00c4\u00fainnovations\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 just sound like a bad idea from the get-go.\n\nLike this cardboard hospital bed that can be turned into a coffin. It is specifically designed for COVID patients.\n\nA factory in Colombia is making hospital beds that can be turned into a coffin if the patient dies These dual-purpose beds are designed for #COVID19 patients All the latest #coronavirus news here \uf8ff\u00fc\u00eb\u00e1https://t.co/VAjyXIw6P2 pic.twitter.com/1SoZmzDoeZ \u201a\u00c4\u00ee The Telegraph (@Telegraph) May 14, 2020\n\nWould you let your loved one be put in that?\n\nNow, I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not against a sign company looking to meet a need in the community and repurpose their facility for that.\n\nBUT\u201a\u00c4\u00b6 there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s just so much wrong with this.\n\nFirst, having a hospital bed that converts into a coffin is just ghoulish. We don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t send people to the hospital expecting them to die. There is no hope left when someone is put in a bed that could instantly be converted into their coffin.\n\nSecond, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s made of cardboard. That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s dehumanizing. This isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t a small pet that you bury in the backyard in a shoebox, these are human beings not Speedy the Wonder Hamster that your third-grader is crying over.\n\nRemind me, what happens when cardboard gets wet? Because that could be a problem. You clearly can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t clean someone on this thing, and what about feeding? What happens if someone spills water on it? The biggest problem that I see is that the body itself contains fluids like blood, saliva, sputum, urine, and other things, all of which can spread disease. Even if this thing was treated to be \u201a\u00c4\u00fawaterproof\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d have to toss it the minute bodily fluids touched it and in a hospital setting that would be in pretty short order.\n\nThis is a clear case of \u201a\u00c4\u00fadidn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think that one through\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00fadidn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t consult with a single medical professional.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBut you know that morons in government are going to see this as a brilliant and much-needed innovation in the midst of a pandemic.\n\nSpeaking of morons in government\u201a\u00c4\u00b6\n\nThese bed/coffin combo units might be Governor Cuomo\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s new state-mandated nursing home beds\u201a\u00c4\u00ecbecause that completely fits with his policies. Maybe he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll add in blankets that can double as a body-bag since he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s already sending body bags to nursing homes.\n\n[Quick Update from the author: I think I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m being unfair to Governor Cuomo who has rescinded his disastrous policy that forces nursing homes to take COVID-positive patients now that thousands of people senselessly died. I should also include the other governors who sent COVID-positive patients into nursing homes but have not rescinded the order like New Jersey\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Phil Murphy and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, as well as those simply covering up the data like California\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Gavin Newsom.]\n\nNote to the creators of this horrific hospital bed/coffin hybrid\u201a\u00c4\u00b6\n\nJust because you can do something, doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t mean that you should do it."

                    "article_content": "Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s measures of success. But after a manic 3\u00ac\u03a9 years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.\n\nBy far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not going to play that game,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not uniform across states and across countries.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBut even beyond the death count, there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the official said.\n\nSome Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t been able to focus on getting the response right.\n\nTrump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSo it is a war and I define victory when it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said on May 1. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt can never be a total victory because too many people have died.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nWhen American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.\n\nOthers are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAllowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 argued one Republican close to the president.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sen. Lindsey Graham\n\nBut, he added, \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf things don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t look like they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re bouncing back by September, I think that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to be a problem.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe fear that Trump can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.\n\nWhen asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the \u201a\u00c4\u00faeconomic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nA spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.\n\nOthers are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)"

But Queens also has a much higher population density with 20,500 people per square mile compared to 5,500 per square mile in Cook County, which can make social distancing measures more challenging to maintain.\n\n1:55 p.m. Lightfoot hints at street closures to help restaurants\n\nIs Mayor Lori Lightfoot planning to close streets and sidewalks so restaurants can safely reopen and give residents a place to run, walk and play? Sure sounds like it.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faPeople are itching to get outside. Businesses are looking at creative ways to serve customers. The key is how we do it,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the mayor tweeted Friday.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faStay tuned for some changes to our streets and sidewalks. Transportation is more than just cars. We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll show how Chicago can be safer and easier to get around.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nLast week, Illinois Restaurant Association President Sam Toia urged Gov. J.B. Pritzker to relax his five-step plan to reopen Illinois by allowing restaurants to open at 25% of capacity beginning June 1 with strict safeguards for restaurant employees, including face masks and daily temperature checks.\n\nAt the time, Toia teased the street closing idea.\n\nRead the full report from Fran Spielman here.\n\n1:27 p.m. Lightfoot warns religious leaders she is prepared to enforce stay-at-home order\n\nMayor Lori Lightfoot has appealed to religious leaders to not defy Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s stay-at-home order \u201a\u00c4\u00ee and warned she is prepared to \u201a\u00c4\u00faenforce the rules\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 if they don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t.\n\nIn a \u201a\u00c4\u00faDear Members of the Chicago Faith Community\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 letter sent Thursday, Lightfoot urged religious leaders to continue holding virtual services rather than in-person services, where it is difficult, if not impossible, to maintain social distance.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI am urging you to stay the course. If there is a problem, I would rather be in conversation than in conflict. But to be clear, I am resolute that I must enforce the rules of the governor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s stay-at-home order. To be fair to all, I simply cannot look away from non-compliance, no matter the source or the intention,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she wrote.\n\nOn Monday, Lightfoot responded to Sunday service defiance by saying she hoped to educate religious leaders into compliance, avoiding mass arrests.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not gonna send in the police to arrest parishioners. People are exercising their faith, and I understand that,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said then.\n\nBut the next day, the mayor made it clear she was serious about enforcing the governor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s order and she would do what she must.\n\nRead the full report from Fran Spielman here.\n\n12:59 p.m. Cubs chairman Tom Ricketts not sure baseball will be played this season: report\n\nCubs chairman Tom Ricketts told season-ticket holders he is not sure baseball will be played this year.\n\nAccording to a story published by The Athletic, Ricketts said the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, conflicts over the best time to reopen businesses, and continuing negotiations between the owners and players could combine to prevent the start of the season.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think anyone can answer that question just yet,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ricketts said during a virtual forum with season-ticket holders Thursday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe current thinking and the current discussions (among owners) have been all around trying to get back into our home ballparks for this season. Obviously, without fans. Now that creates three specific problems that we have to address.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe team has been consulting with health professionals on the best way to make Wrigley Field safe, according to a recording of Cubs president Crane Kenney obtained by The Athletic.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00ee Sun-Times Staff\n\n12:26 p.m. The high cost of quarantine\n\nIn a letter to the Sun-Times editors, Tom Gregg of Niles writes:\n\nBefore the quarantine, I was visiting my 99-year-old mother twice a day in our retirement home, and she was holding her own in terms of her health. She is vision-impaired, hearing-impaired, arthritic and suffering from mild dementia, certainly, but for 13 years in two homes she had largely been able to avoid hospital stays for life-threatening problems. Plus, her interaction with me seemed to greatly help in minimizing her spells of confusion.\n\nBut now, during our relatively brief period of enforced separation \u201a\u00c4\u00ee I live on a lower floor while she lives up on an assisted living floor \u201a\u00c4\u00ee she has contracted pneumonia, for which she has been in and out of hospital, and her spells of confusion seem to be worsening. Symptomatic, doubtless, of the unprecedented disorientation.\n\nMy mother remains among the living today, but for how long if she remains so isolated? Now multiply this single case by all the other seniors around the country who have seen their precious interactive routines disappear. It is a situation that many of them, given their cognitive limitations, have difficulty grasping.\n\nThis potentially lethal hardship is worth noting when we are formulating pandemic recovery plans. The cure of the quarantine shouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t cost more than the contagion itself, should it?\n\nRead this and more letters here.\n\n11:44 a.m. What\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the first meal you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll want at a restaurant post-pandemic? We asked, Chicagoans answered.\n\nWith eat-in dining at restaurants on hold because of the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s coronavirus stay-at-home order, the next time you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll be waited on at a restaurant probably won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be for a while.\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s five-phase plan for reopening Illinois businesses puts restaurant reopenings in Phase 4. We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re now in Phase 2.\n\nSo with Chicagoans craving a meal out, we asked: Once restaurants reopen for dining in, what\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the first meal you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll want to eat out, and from where?

Trump has lavished attention on the Abbott ID NOW test and featured it at a White House event three days after the FDA fast-tracked its approval by granting an emergency use authorization on March 27.\n\nIn just a few weeks time, Abbott has shipped 1.8 million of the ID NOW tests, which is used at several Chicago-area testing sites.\n\nThe FDA warning came a day after a New York University preliminary study raised questions about its accuracy. The study was not subject to peer review, a process that checks on the procedures used for a study as well as its findings.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n7:03 a.m. \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Grandstanding\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 by Grand Old Party?

But these are not normal times.\n\nThe Lightfoot administration is preoccupied with the city\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s response to the coronavirus and the budget crisis triggered by the stay-at-home shutdown of the Chicago economy.\n\nSo the decision was made to proceed only with those capital projects and purchases that absolutely needed to get done and to finance it with a line of credit that remained, even after Lightfoot saved $22 million by eliminating a $1.4 billion line of credit negotiated by former Mayor Rahm Emanuel.\n\nRead the full story by Fran Spielman here.\n\nNew cases\n\nAnalysis & Commentary\n\n7:47 p.m. Everything must be on the table as city, state fight back from financial devastation\n\nWashington to cities and states: You\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re on your own.\n\nFor months, the Trump administration has failed to take the lead in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, punting responsibility to the states. Now the president and his Republican Party are looking to do the same when it comes to helping states and cities survive the pandemic\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s financial devastation.\n\nA $3 trillion stimulus package expected to be approved by the Democratic-controlled House looks dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate, and President Donald Trump is making clear he would never sign such a bill.\n\nWhy? Because the package to rescue drowning cities, suburbs, states, small businesses and unemployed Americans would be fiscally imprudent, they claim.\n\nWe couldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t disagree more. And, yes, this is the same Senate and president who rewrote the federal tax code in 2017 to give billions of dollars in tax cuts to the wealthiest one percent of Americans, ballooning the federal deficit.\n\nSo what does all this mean for Illinois and Chicago, as well as for towns and counties statewide?\n\nRead the full editorial from the CST Editorial Board here.\n\n6:35 p.m. Gov. Pritzker fumbles rollout of \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Restore Illinois\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\n\nFor many weeks after the beginning of this COVID-19 crisis, Gov. J.B. Pritzker proved adept at telegraphing his every move.\n\nPritzker waited until people practically begged him to shut down the schools on March 15. He talked about issuing a stay-at-home order for days, and then acted on March 21 only after California jumped first.\n\nIt was clear for days that he would extend his stay-at-home order another month starting April 1. He talked for well over a week about a mask-wearing requirement, always noting that he was being lobbied by Republican state Rep. Mark Batinick before finally announcing the order on April 23.\n\nPeople did not always agreed with him, but they always had a sense of where he was going. Pritzker did get out over his skis when his Illinois Workers\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 Compensation Commission dramatically altered the burden of proof on COVID-19 illnesses in favor of employees without so much as a heads-up to business groups. But most regular folks never noticed that and a court intervened and stopped the order anyway.\n\nOtherwise, the governor did a remarkably good job of making sure the public was always aware in advance of his leadership direction.\n\nAnd then on May 5 he announced his \u201a\u00c4\u00faRestore Illinois\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 roadmap to gradually reopen the state.\n\nRead the full column from Rich Miller here.\n\n6:53 a.m. Chicago\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s flag, civic pride and the fight against COVID-19\n\nIf Chicago were to add a fifth star to the city\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s flag, an awful lot of hipsters would have to get their tattoos reworked.\n\nMaybe it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s best we just leave the flag as it is, even if the city manages to prevail against COVID-19.\n\nLast Friday and again on Wednesday, Mayor Lori Lightfoot floated the idea of adding a fifth red star to Chicago\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s flag to mark the city\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s response to the coronavirus pandemic. She was trying to rally the city. If Chicago\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s effort to beat the virus is terrifically successful, she said Friday, it will \u201a\u00c4\u00fatruly warrant a fifth star on our flag.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBut let\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s be blunt. Chicago\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not about to be terrifically successful anytime soon. Nobody is. This is a global public health war that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s sure to be fought for years, and a lot of people are setting us up to lose.\n\nRead the full Sun-Times editorial here.\n\n6:10 a.m. Navy Pier is an arm of government, no matter what it claims \u201a\u00c4\u00ee so let\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s see every contract\n\nNow that the nonprofit that runs Navy Pier is getting a federal stimulus loan of nearly $2.5 million, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s really way past time that it opened its books to the public completely.\n\nNavy Pier Inc., which leases the 104-year-old pier from the public, is a government body that masquerades as a nonprofit organization. As such, it has been allowed to hide its workings from public scrutiny while benefiting from public support.\n\nNavy Pier Inc. pays just $1 a year to the state and city to lease the pier.\n\nAnd just this week, Sun-Times reporters Tim Novak and Robert Herguth revealed that the organization, whose president is paid more than $540,000 a year, has received a nearly $2.5 million coronavirus stimulus loan from the federal government\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Paycheck Protection Program.\n\nLike all nonprofits, Navy Pier Inc. must disclose much of its finances by filing 990 forms, but it does not have to comply with Freedom of Information Act requests or disclose the terms of contracts.\n\nRead the full editorial here."

A day earlier, presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that in order to remove quarantine restrictions, one needs to know the dynamics of the spread of the virus on May 11 and take into account peculiarities of Russian regions.\n\nOn May 6, it was reported that Olga Lyubimova, Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Minister of Culture, became infected with the coronavirus. The minister is going through the mild course of the disease, so there is no need to hospitalize her yet. Olga Lyubimova has thus become a third member of the Russian government, who was infected with COVID-19.\n\nOn April 30, it was reported that the Prime Minister of Russia Mikhail Mishustin was infected with coronavirus. Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov has been appointed acting head of government. On May 1, Vladimir Yakushev, the Minister of Construction, Housing and Communal Services of Russia, was also hospitalized with coronavirus.\n\nRussians persistently violate self-isolation regime\n\nMeanwhile, Russia will have to experience a new surge in the incidence of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, Ivan Konovalov, assistant professor of infectious diseases in children at the Russian National Medical University named after Pirogov said.\n\nAccording to the professor, Russia will see a sharp growth of infections in one or two weeks because most Russians violate self-isolation regime during May holidays. \u201a\u00c4\u00faNo plateau is yet in sight as it requires no growth trend for several consecutive weeks,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the specialist said.\n\nIf citizens start taking to the streets thinking that everyone will catch COVID-19 sooner or later, the number of seriously ill patients will start snowballing. Such a trend is especially dangerous for regions where hospitals are already overwhelmed, while many doctors quit their jobs and leave being unable to cope with hard conditions of work."

                    "article_content": "The Egyptian superstar, who netted 29 goals for the Merseyside squad last season and was named the best Premier League player in 2017/2018, constantly appears in sports news with the world\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s best clubs wanting to sign the 27-year-old.\n\nLiverpool striker Mohamed Salah rejected an offer by Real Madrid in 2018, the Egyptian national team assistant coach has revealed. In an interview with OnTime Sports Hany Ramzy said Salah broke the news during training.\"I was talking to Salah and he told me that Real Madrid had sent him an offer. The offer was really good, but Salah discussed it with me and Mr Cuper [the former coach of Egypt's national football team ], and he decided to stay with Liverpool because he was comfortable there\", Ramzy told OnTime Sports.\n\nIt appears that Salah's decision to stay at Anfield paid off. The Reds, who lost to Real Madrid in the Champions League final that year, performed brilliantly the following year. Not only did they win the most prestigious club football tournament in the world last season, making an historic comeback against Barcelona in the semi-final, they finished second in the Premier League losing one point to champions Manchester City and Salah played the key role in the club's success. This year Liverpool has looked leven more stunning. The Reds are on top of the Premier League table with a 25 point lead and are on the way to winning their first domestic trophy after a 30-year title drought.\n\nThe English Premier League plans to resume on 12 June after a long break caused by the coronavirus pandemic. However, not all players are happy about it. Chelsea striker Willian is keen to return to the pitch, but only when it is safe to do so. Britain has the second highest death toll (34,466) from the infectious disease after the United States (90,113). The number of confirmed cases stands at 240,161, according to real-time statistics website Worldometer."

                    "article_content": "Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s measures of success. But after a manic 3\u00ac\u03a9 years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.\n\nBy far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not going to play that game,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not uniform across states and across countries.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBut even beyond the death count, there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the official said.\n\nSome Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t been able to focus on getting the response right.\n\nTrump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSo it is a war and I define victory when it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said on May 1. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt can never be a total victory because too many people have died.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nWhen American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.\n\nOthers are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAllowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 argued one Republican close to the president.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sen. Lindsey Graham\n\nBut, he added, \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf things don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t look like they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re bouncing back by September, I think that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to be a problem.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe fear that Trump can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.\n\nWhen asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the \u201a\u00c4\u00faeconomic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nA spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.\n\nOthers are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)"

Take a quick trip to our Predictive Programming section, and you will see immediately what we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re talking about.\n\nAll this brings us to an interview the TODAY Show did with Melinda Gates back on November 8th, where we see Melinda wearing an upside-down, or inverted, cross around her neck.\n\nWho likes to wear inverted crosses? Satanists, pagans, witches, warlocks, New Agers, most people in Hollywood \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 you get the idea.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faChrist hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Galatians 3:13 (KJB)\n\nThe early First Century Christians never used the cross as a sign or symbol for anything, why? Because it was the instrument of the torturous death of Jesus of Nazareth.\n\nThe cross as iconic symbolism would not appear until biblical Christianity was hijacked by the Romans around 325 AD. From that point on you see crosses on everything as Rome infused paganism with Christianity.\n\nThe bible tells us that the cross is the sign of a curse, and cursed people hang on them. No one in their right minds who believed the bible would want the sign of a curse hanging around their own necks, much less wearing an upside-down cross like the pagans / satanists do.\n\nI will let you make up your own mind as to why Melinda Gates chose to wear an upside-down cross on national television.\n\nI know she went to Catholic school, and that she and Bill have raised their children as Catholics.\n\nBut when you look at the millions of dollars they give to Planned Parenthood, an organization that exists to slaughter children in the womb, exactly what kind of Catholic she is gets a little murky, to say the least.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church, what I like to call counterfeit Christianity, loves weird occult and pagan symbolism.\n\nOver the years we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve shown you the Vatican Audience Hall that is shaped exactly like a giant snake, and has the freakiest, most nastiest-looking statue right behind here the pope sits. [It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s also worth mentioning that the pope\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s throne has a massive inverted cross on it.]\n\nOccult symbolism pervades the Vatican to a very high degree. Melinda Gates is a Catholic, you do the math.\n\nMelinda Gates on pandemic: \u201a\u00c4\u00f2We haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t had leadership at the national level \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s chaos\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\n\nFROM TODAY: As part of our coronavirus series The Search for Solutions, TODAY\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Savannah Guthrie spoke exclusively to Melinda Gates, who is working to address the pandemic through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nShe says there are \u201a\u00c4\u00faa few good candidates\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 for a vaccine and that the U.S. needs \u201a\u00c4\u00fato start looking at a paid medical leave policy\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to help workers on the front lines.\n\nShe also criticizes the Trump administration for its response to the crisis: \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t had leadership at the national level \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s chaos.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 (Read more)\n\nI will include the top comments just incase they decide to close the comments section:\n\nSource: Nowtheendbegins.com"

                    "article_content": "is a UK journalist, ex-Fleet Street editor, financial industry consultant and political communications special advisor in the UK and EU.\n\nis a UK journalist, ex-Fleet Street editor, financial industry consultant and political communications special advisor in the UK and EU.\n\nFeminists on the frontline of gender politics have seized on a poll they helped publish to push their agenda to the fore in a crisis that has wrecked everyone\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s economies and lives. Disproportionate male deaths got a side note.\n\nA new poll by IPSOS Mori declares that UK women are bearing the emotional brunt of the coronavirus pandemic. Fair point, but is it sexist to mention that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s men who actually die more?\n\nIn fact, men are almost twice as likely as women to die from the coronavirus, but women, as the study has found, are about 15 to 20 percent more worried about various other aspects of the pandemic.\n\nI get it. The poll was published in conjunction with the Fawcett Society, named for the iconic suffragette Millicent Fawcett, so with a touch of cynicism you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll see the goal here.\n\nAlso on rt.com Covid-19 is a disaster for everyone\u201a\u00c4\u00b6 except straight white men?\n\nEven though the study mentions up front the fact men are in more danger from disease itself, that mention is nowhere to be found in the headlines on the Fawcett Society (why would it be?), or IPSOS, or the Guardian, which declares: \u201a\u00c4\u00f2UK women bear emotional brunt of Covid-19 turmoil \u201a\u00c4\u00ec poll\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 and mentions problems of risk and unemployment they face. Their stories do mention that men are dying disproportionately but hey, women are affected in other ways that aren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t death.\n\nAnd isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t that more important? My guess is I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m seen as a man just propagating a culture of male domination, though biased feminist polling is a-okay.\n\nPolls are commissioned to prove a point that needs apparently objective validation. Very rarely does a political outfit pay a polling company without having a fair idea of what the results will be. What they seek is the credibility earned by using an independent polling business that gives the results kudos.\n\nSo we have 61 percent of women struggling day to day to stay positive while 47 percent of men admit to feeling the same.\n\nIn gender politics the old adage that a woman\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s work is never done holds true, particularly when that woman is fighting on the feminist frontline and there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s suddenly an unexpected opportunity to strike a blow against the patriarchal hegemony.\n\nManning up\n\nRead more\n\nWhat is conveniently overlooked is that data collection on an issue such as this is skewed by its very nature.\n\nYou\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not asking what sort of soap powder an interviewee prefers here, you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re asking men and women how they feel.\n\nAnd there lies the problem. While women are far more upfront about peaks and troughs in their emotions, a man asked to explain his feelings will do nothing of the sort. Hardwired to put on a front, most blokes will shrug and mumble, \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not too worried\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 even when pushed whether he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s concerned at the death of thousands of his countrymen at the hands of an invisible virus.\n\nIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not that it isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t something to bother about or that men are mostly unfeeling, uncaring boneheaded neanderthals, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s just that the average Joe would rather not discuss his emotions with you and a relatively neutral answer is far more likely to end a line of questioning sooner than if he opened up and blubbed out his darkest nightmares.\n\nSo while six out of 10 women admit they are struggling and less than half of men questioned admitted to feeling likewise, it has to be concluded, \u201a\u00c4\u00faWell they would say that!\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s people who suffer, not men or women\n\nAnd it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not just the elastic treatment of poll results that irritate here, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the gender politics at play when it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s really not appropriate.\n\nIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00f2people\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 who are suffering, whose loved ones are dead, jobs lost, schools shut and dreams in tatters.\n\nIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not a man and woman thing, its humanity as a whole and it is wrong and insensitive to prioritise one group over another, whether they be different sexes, ages, races or religions. But Sam Smethers, the Fawcett Society CEO, has found a man-shaped windmill to tilt at pushing a feminist agenda that somehow men are using the pandemic to assert masculine dominance.\n\nShe recently drummed up support from the various members of The Sisterhood to sign a joint statement explaining how bad things are for women in the UK since the pandemic struck.\n\nAlso on rt.com The gender sleep gap? Wake me up when the nightmare of modern feminism is over\n\nThe statement spoke of women being \u201a\u00c4\u00falargely invisible from the debate and excluded from decision-making,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and many were \u201a\u00c4\u00fatrapped in their homes, self-isolating with an abusive partner\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 as if this was the norm. I found that claim insulting.\n\nIt goes on about \u201a\u00c4\u00faspecific challenges women are facing,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 having \u201a\u00c4\u00favoices heard\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00faneeds met.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Certainly, interesting ideas to discuss, and there may even be some valid demands in there.\n\nThere is no mention anywhere among these concerns about who the majority of victims of the Covid-19 crisis might be.\n\nIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s strange, because they are the grandfathers, fathers, husbands and sons of the gender-obsessed feminist brigade who insist on propagating nonsense like this week\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s poll results.\n\nLike this story?

SpaceX had been working to qualify a new design of the parachute systems that NASA said it is now comfortable with.\n\nBehnken and Hurley have been in quarantine for more than a week, a normal procedure for astronauts going to space. But NASA and SpaceX have said they have been taking additional precautions because of the coronavirus pandemic. At a news briefing Friday, Hurley said he and Behnken have been tested for the coronavirus twice and \u201a\u00c4\u00farumor has it we might be tested again before we go.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe pair would join Chris Cassidy, the lone NASA astronaut on board the station, and two Russian counterparts.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faHe likes solitude,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Hurley said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut it was very obvious that he is ready for some human interaction with us.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9"

The post would place him in charge of overseeing a roughly $500 billion Treasury fund for industry created as part of the economic rescue law approved in late March.\n\nGet the latest news about the coronavirus and its ripple effects in Chicago and Illinois in our live blog.\n\nIn prepared testimony, Miller pledged to be vigilant in protecting the integrity and independence of his office and vowed \u201a\u00c4\u00fato seek the truth in all matters that come before me and to use my authority and resources to uncover fraud, waste and abuse.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\n\nMiller has worked at the Justice Department and was inspector general for nearly a decade at the General Services Administration, which oversees thousands of federal contracts. While he is respected in the oversight community, Miller\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s role in the White House counsel\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office \u201a\u00c4\u00ee which led Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s defense during impeachment \u201a\u00c4\u00ee is troubling, Democrats and watchdog groups said.\n\nOhio Sen. Sherrod Brown, top Democrat on the banking panel, said he questions whether Miller will be able to hold the Trump administration accountable for how it administers the business program and \u201a\u00c4\u00faguarantee that corporations getting taxpayer money put their workers first.\u201a\u00c4\u2265\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faMr. Miller will be called upon to answer how he will ensure he is independent and will hold the administration accountable,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 Brown said in a statement.\n\nNoah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said Miller\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nomination is part of a pattern of \u201a\u00c4\u00faroadblocks thrown up\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 by Trump to block oversight of his administration.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has fired an inspector general tied to his impeachment and sidelined another who was set to lead a group of inspectors general overseeing the rescue package. On Friday night, Trump moved to replace yet another inspector general, an acting official who criticized the coronavirus response by federal health officials.\n\nTrump also said in signing the rescue law that he will resist oversight provisions.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faAll of this taken together means real oversight will be met with retribution, which makes it all the more important,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 Bookbinder said."

                    "article_content": "Photo illustration by Slate. Rendering by urfinguss/iStock/Getty Images Plus.\n\nThis article is part of Reopenings, a series about how businesses are operating during the pandemic.\n\nYou can gamble again in America\u201a\u00c4\u00eeat least in the few parts of the country where casinos are cautiously reopening. Casinos in Oklahoma and Montana already have the go-ahead from their state governments to operate, though many are opting to stay closed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Some casinos on tribal lands in Michigan and Idaho have also opened their doors, since they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re only regulated by the federal government and do not have to abide by state-mandated lockdowns.\n\nBut casinos in the After Times won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be the same bustling, hand-contact-heavy places they were. They\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll have fewer games, more protective barriers, and a lot less razzle-dazzle.\n\nTake the Tonkawa Hotel & Casino, operated by the Tonkawa tribe and one of the few casinos in Oklahoma that chose to go back into business when the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s lockdown on nonessential businesses ended on May 1. (Many tribes have opted to voluntarily follow state lockdowns.) Now the casino is spacing out slot machines, installing hand sanitizer dispensers throughout the property, requiring employees to wear masks and gloves, increasing the frequency of cleanings for cage counters and card tables, and using thermal cameras to check whether people entering are running a temperature above 100 degrees, according to its director of marketing, Billy Burt.\n\nExpect similar protocols as casinos around the country reopen their floors. Executives at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket, Connecticut, have been following the initial openings in developing their own practices for when they eventually begin operations again, whenever that is. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSince we closed on March 17, we have been putting together a reopening plan,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 interim CEO Jason Guyot said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIn our 28-year history, Foxwood had never closed its doors, so it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s been a pretty surreal process we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been going through.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nWhen Foxwoods reopens, it won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t offer poker, sports betting, keno, and bingo\u201a\u00c4\u00eepartly due to crowding concerns, and partly because the casino won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be bringing back enough staff at first to man all those games. For games like black jack, players won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be allowed to touch the cards and decks will be switched out more often, particularly when a new dealer takes over a shift. Foxwoods is strongly considering putting up plastic partitions between slot machines as well as at card tables to separate dealers from gamblers and gamblers from one another. A Las Vegas company called Screaming Images is currently developing recyclable clear acrylic dividers to keep people semi-isolated, which are being tested at the El Cortez casino in the city\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s downtown:\n\nI shot photos of these partitions this morning for @mickakers story about a company building them. https://t.co/qzKWBHm7hz via @reviewjournal \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Kevin M. Cannon (@kmcannonphoto) April 28, 2020\n\nMany matters are still up in the air. For instance, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unclear when performers can put on shows again, given the crowds they attract. However, Guyot is generally not too concerned about crowding at the property overall, because it spans more than 9 million square feet. Foxwoods managers are still trying to figure out how to clean betting chips. According to Guyot, many cleaning chemicals can cause them to discolor or stick together. And though employees will be sanitizing the chips multiple times throughout the day, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s still difficult to keep them clean once people start passing them around.\n\nFoxwoods and many other casinos have self-exclusion lists for people with gambling problems who voluntarily ask the establishments to bar them from entry. Given that Foxwoods will require all visitors to wear masks, it may be difficult to identify these people. For now, the plan is to ask people to temporarily remove their masks during the screening process just long enough for a camera to get a good glimpse of their faces.\n\nLike Foxwoods, most major casino chains have yet to set definitive reopening dates, though they have been gradually releasing details about the modifications they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll be making to their facilities to limit the virus\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s spread, partly based on stipulations from local regulators. For instance, the Nevada Gaming Control Board recently released guidelines for how casinos should adjust their business practices. Gambling establishments in Las Vegas and elsewhere in the state will need to devise plans to limit the number of people at card tables, sanitize items more regularly, and ensure that workers and guests are wearing masks. Wynn Resorts has said that it will be removing chairs from table games and has publicly released sanitation procedures for each individual game. The Venetian is using UV lights and electrostatic sprayers to clean its facilities. One Las Vegas casino is even handing out plastic sticks for people to press elevator buttons with, according to the Associated Press. Wynn and some other casinos are hoping to reopen at the end of May. Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman has repeatedly called for the city to reopen and serve as a testing ground for the rest of the country.\n\nThe elderly population, which is a huge demographic for casinos, might not want to risk infection.\n\nThese new regulations are sure to change casinos\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 atmosphere and even the dynamics and strategy of some games. For example, craps tables in Nevada will only be allowed to have six players at a time, which probably means that casino floors will be a lot quieter. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSometimes in a casino you hear all this screaming and yelling because at the craps table you get an excited crowd and somebody gets on a hot roll,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Steve Bourie, author of the American Casino Guide. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHard to do that with six people. Normally you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d have 20, 25 people around a hot table.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Bourie also mentioned that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll be tougher for card sharks, who usually make money off less-skilled players, to find targets since there will only be four people per poker table in Nevada rather than the usual 10. And he predicts that some casinos may have to raise limits on black jack games because the house won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be able to make as much money with only three players allowed at each table.\n\nGuyot has put a lot of thought into how these new measures will change the casino-going experience. He worries that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll be tough for employees to convey warmth and congeniality given that they have to wear masks and distance themselves from customers. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen you see someone with a mask on, even when you have one on, you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not as comfortable engaging,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faOne of the biggest things from a team-member perspective is that there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to be less of that service interaction with a smile.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Foxwoods is working on altering its training program given that employees\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 facial expressions won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be as visible to customers.\n\nWhen more casinos do get back up and running, Bourie isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t quite sure just how many people will actually show up. He notes that the elderly population, which is a huge demographic for casinos, might not want to risk infection. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m sure a lot of people are going to be scared. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a form of entertainment and people develop habits of going to casinos and having fun,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut their habits have been broken, and they haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t gone in six weeks or so. So some people may find that they might not want to go so much anymore. They\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re scared.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Bourie noted that online gambling has seen a surge in recent weeks, so people may opt to stick with that for the time being."

                    "article_content": "If 2020 does meet that forecast, it would mark a new record of five consecutive above-normal Atlantic hurricane seasons, surpassing a previous record of four seasons during 1998 to 2001, Gerry Bell, the lead forecaster with the Climate Prediction Center, told reporters.\n\nNOAA's Climate Prediction Center predicted a 60 percent chance of an above-normal 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, with a 30 percent chance of a near-normal season. The agency predicted just a 10 percent chance of a below-normal season.\n\n\"NOAA's analysis of current and seasonal atmospheric conditions reveals a recipe for an active Atlantic hurricane season this year,\" said acting NOAA Administrator Neil Jacobs in a statement.\n\nThe outlook for the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season also comes as researchers at NOAA and the University of Wisconsin-Madison identified a link between the growing intensity of tropical storms and human-driven climate change, mapping out the growing strength of hurricanes and typhoons over the past four decades.\n\nNOAA said Thursday a combination of factors contributed to predictions for above-normal storm activity, including warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, as well as El Ni\u221a\u00b1o conditions that can suppress hurricane activity and are expected to remain neutral or to trend toward La Ni\u221a\u00b1a.\n\nShould more of this year's storms make landfall, it could pose problems for state and local emergency responders and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which have been dealing with the coronavirus pandemic and would see their efforts complicated by social distancing and other measures enacted to slow the spread of Covid-19.\n\nFEMA warned earlier this week that this year's hurricane season poses \"added complexities\" for first responders and state and local officials amid the pandemic. It's advised communities to secure \"non-congregate\" shelters for evacuees, such as hotels and dormitories, and ensure search-and-rescue teams and volunteers have proper protective equipment to prevent the spread of Covid-19.\n\nCarlos Castillo, acting deputy administrator for resilience at FEMA, told reporters that the agency has responded to more than one large disaster at the same time before, such as in 2018, when the agency responded to two major hurricanes on the East Coast and wildfires in California.\n\n\"I want to reassure the nation that FEMA continues to take deliberate and proactive steps, working closely with our state, local, tribal, territorial, federal, nonprofit and private sector partners to safeguard our ability to respond and recover from future disasters that may arise during this pandemic,\" Castillo said.\n\nIn a hurricane preparation guidance released Wednesday, FEMA said it will \u201a\u00c4\u00fagenerally minimize\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 deployments to disaster-hit areas, an acknowledgment of both strained capacity and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to limit unnecessary person-to-person contact to curb the coronavirus. Instead, FEMA will rely more on virtual coordination.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIf you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re in a situation where you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve got a declaration or where a storm has hit, yeah, we are looking at ways to scale back,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 FEMA spokesperson Lea Crager told POLITICO.\n\nSocial distancing measures also have complicated evacuation plans for areas that lie in a storm's path. FEMA has discouraged use of gymnasiums, arenas and convention centers that traditionally double as shelters. FEMA instead emphasized \u201a\u00c4\u00fanon-congregate\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 shelters such as hotels and dormitories, and suggested people consider staying home even under conditions like power outages.\n\nAs a result, overall shelter capacity will likely be diminished this year, Crager said, meaning communities will have to \u201a\u00c4\u00fathink outside the box\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ee though she acknowledged people might be afraid to go to shelters anyway given potential for viral infection. FEMA has tried to smooth the process for emergency planners by signaling to them early that it will reimburse a portion \u201a\u00c4\u00ee typically at least 75 percent \u201a\u00c4\u00ee of expenses for securing those types of non-congregate shelters.\n\nThe long-standing emergency plans that communities dust off every hurricane season tend to rely on massive shelters, so changing their procedures will present challenges, said Daniel Kaniewski, the former FEMA deputy administrator who left the agency in February.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faYou want to get this nailed down with as much advance notice as possible so states can plan based on that policy,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Kaniewski, who is now managing director at insurance firm Marsh & McLennan. \u201a\u00c4\u00faHonestly, when these policies change, it takes a lot of coordination and planning and even exercising of that new policy. You can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t just flip a switch.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBut some towns don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have enough hotels or motels to meet local needs, said Colin Wellenkamp, executive director of the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative, which works with local governments along the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s largest river.\n\nEven coping with the simplest preparations that FEMA has outlined is a struggle, he said, and many local governments will struggle to pay for rooms even if they have them, or to cover the costs for personal protective equipment and acquire tests needed to handle potential evacuees.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWhat cities are telling me is they don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have enough money right now to handle a pandemic and a major disaster at the same time,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Wellenkamp said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve spent so much money on the pandemic and our revenues have taken such a hit because of the closures and unemployment.\"\n\nEven if the federal government promises to reimburse localities, that \"doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t help you if you don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have the cash to make the purchases in the first place,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Wellenkamp added.\n\nThe twin pandemic and hurricane efforts are also stretching nonprofit organizations that help locate shelter sites, staff evacuation centers and bring in necessary supplies and food, said Gregory Forrester, CEO of National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster, a coalition of nonprofit groups.\n\nMany volunteers are elderly and will be vulnerable to Covid-19, he said, which, combined with the imperative to keep the virus from spreading to new areas, means trying to find additional local personnel without underlying medical conditions. Many nonprofits also haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t been able to fundraise for the hurricane season while they respond to the coronavirus.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe cost factors are higher but you plan for a certain degree and hope for the best,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Forrester said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s like any other hurricane season \u201a\u00c4\u00ee nobody could have ever predicted a Harvey and Maria within six weeks of each other\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in 2017."

Funded by the communist regime, these centers are marketed as Chinese language and culture centers. However, U.S. intelligence officials have warned that these centers are little more than \u201a\u00c4\u00fapropaganda\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 arms of the communist country.\n\nThe radical left will stop at nothing to intimidate conservative students on college campuses.

But they\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4re taking advantage of it.\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f9\n\nCIA reports obtained by\u221a\u00c7 The Washington Free Beacon\u221a\u00c7 further revealed, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe [Chinese Communist Party] provides \u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f2strings-attached\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 funding to academic institutions and think tanks to deter research that casts it in a negative light. It has used this tactic to reward pro-China viewpoints and coerce Western academic publications and conferences to self-censor. The CCP often denies visas to academics who criticize the regime, encouraging many China scholars to preemptively self-censor so they can maintain access to the country on which their research depends.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nWhile legislation signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2018 resulted in about a dozen U.S. colleges shuttering Confucius Institutes on campus, those closures were largely the result of their loss of funding, rather than concerns for the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s national security.\n\nAnd now, nearly two years after that legislation became law, more than 75 Confucius Institutes are still in operation in the U.S., most of them on college campuses. From Maine to Florida to Kansas to California, these centers claim to educate American students about Chinese language and culture, and administrators who run the campuses on which they operate appear to believe the same country that claims to have fewer coronavirus deaths than the U.S, despite its population being more than three times the size of the U.S. population.\n\nBased on data from the\u221a\u00c7 National Association of Scholars,\u221a\u00c7 along with records maintained by\u221a\u00c7 Campus Reform, the interactive map below shows the locations where Confucius Institutes still operate.

                    "article_content": "As the coronavirus pandemic continues to worsen in the US, NASA is still moving forward with many of its upcoming missions, including some launches that will send humans to the International Space Station in the near future. As of now, NASA does not foresee any changes being made to these missions, and there are already procedures in place to guarantee astronauts do not bring any illnesses with them into space.\n\nNASA has its own internal \u201a\u00c4\u00faresponse framework\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 for how it plans to deal with the pandemic. It lists four different stages for the agency, which each detail the amount of people who will work from home, the level of access to NASA facilities, and how much travel will be allowed. Right now, two NASA centers \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Ames Research Center and Marshall Space Flight Center \u201a\u00c4\u00ee are on Stage 3, which makes telework mandatory and only allows \u201a\u00c4\u00famission-essential\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 personnel on site at facilities. NASA bumped these two centers to Stage 3 after employees tested positive for COVID-19 at each place.\n\nNASA has its own internal \u201a\u00c4\u00faresponse framework\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 for how to deal with the pandemic\n\nNASA\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Johnson Space Center, which oversees the agency\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s human spaceflight launches and operates the International Space Station, is only at Stage 2. At that level, teleworking is strongly encouraged, though not mandatory, while various facilities are closed down. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe health and safety of NASA\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s workforce is the agency\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s top priority. As the coronavirus (COVID-19) concern continues to escalate, NASA is taking steps to ensure its workforce is protected and informed,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 a NASA spokesperson at JSC said in a statement.\n\nBut as more workers at JSC stay home, they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re still looking ahead to the next launch of people to the ISS, which is slated for April 9th out of Kazakhstan. A Russian Soyuz rocket will launch three crew members, including NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy, to the station, where they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll join three people already in orbit.\n\nThat launch is still on, and NASA says the agency hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t made any changes to operations and schedule surrounding the mission. As of yesterday, Kazakhstan effectively closed its borders after reporting its first coronavirus cases in the country. No one can enter the country except for diplomats, returning citizens, and those invited by the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s government, according to Reuters. NASA is still assessing if changes are needed regarding how personnel will travel to Kazakhstan.\n\nOf course, the concern is that the astronauts flying to the station could carry the coronavirus with them, if they don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know that they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re infected with the virus. But NASA already has a long-held strategy in place for preventing astronauts from carrying any nasty bugs with them to space. All astronauts going to orbit must go through a two-week period of quarantine called \u201a\u00c4\u00fahealth stabilization,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 according to NASA. That way, the agency can make sure the crew is not incubating any illnesses before launch. However, NASA said it \u201a\u00c4\u00fawill continue to evaluate and augment this plan, in coordination with its international and commercial partners\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 if needed.\n\nIn the meantime, Russia\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s state space corporation, Roscosmos, has decided to shut down all media activity surrounding the Soyuz launch, barring journalists from covering the mission in person. Russia will still live stream the launch, and NASA typically airs all of its crewed launches on its own online TV channel.\n\nAll astronauts going to orbit must go through a two-week period of quarantine\n\nOnce this launch is over, the next big milestone for JSC is the return of crew from the ISS. NASA astronauts Andrew Morgan, Jessica Meir, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka are slated to return to Earth in a Soyuz capsule in mid-April, landing in the Kazakhstan desert. Such landings typically require large groups of recovery personnel to extract the astronauts from the landed capsule. NASA did not provide any details if those operations would change in light of the pandemic.\n\nHowever, NASA has more than one upcoming crewed mission on its calendar. Soon, NASA\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s commercial partner SpaceX will be ready to send its first crew of NASA astronauts to the International Space Station. The launch is a critical one for NASA\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Commercial Crew Program, an initiative to develop privately funded vehicles to transport people to and from the ISS. SpaceX has been developing its Crew Dragon capsule for the program, and the first vehicle that will fly a crew of two to the station is already in Florida ahead of its inaugural flight.\n\nSpaceX is currently targeting May for that flight, according to the company\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s president Gwynne Shotwell. NASA also says that SpaceX\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s passengers for the mission, astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, are continuing to train for the mission as originally planned. As for operations at SpaceX, it seems like things are still moving ahead as usual. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk sent an email last week to the company\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s employees underplaying the coronavirus threat, arguing people were more likely to die in a car crash than from the virus.\n\nOf course, the situations at NASA and SpaceX are subject to change quickly. The coronavirus pandemic is ever-evolving, with cities, states, and countries making swift changes every few hours to combat the spread of the disease. And already, launches are being affected. Europe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s primary spaceport in French Guiana, South America is suspending all launches from the site for the foreseeable future, in order to protect the health of employees and people in the area.\n\nIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s possible that upcoming launches from the US could be postponed as well. It just depends on how companies plan to react and if governments take even more decisive action."

                    "article_content": "Fewer humans carelessly destroying their natural habitat has been a blessing for sea turtles in Florida.\n\nWith many beaches closed in Florida during the coronavirus pandemic, researchers see less plastic and less waste. There are fewer people and vehicles on the beach projecting artificial light; thus there is less disorientation for emerging hatchlings, according to David Godfrey, Executive Director for the Sea Turtle Conservancy.\n\nBecause of these factors, sea turtles can build nests without any disruptions.\n\nGodfrey said that nesting season for leatherback turtles, the largest of all sea turtles, is underway right now, mostly in the central-east and southeast coast of Florida. They nest in fewer numbers than the loggerheads, who arrive in May. Later in the summer months is when green turtles will come.\n\nIt takes approximately 60 days for sea turtle eggs to incubate and for hatchlings to emerge, Godfrey said. Many disturbing things can happen to their nests when humans take over their beaches. They trample and dig up the turtle\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nests and harm them with artificial light.\n\nRELATED STORY:\n\nRELATED STORY:\n\nWith an inactive beach, the turtles can carry on the way nature intended. Godfrey said:\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI think there is a strong likelihood that we will see decreased human-caused impacts on sea turtle nesting this year, which is a rare silver lining to this global pandemic. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s premature to try and use numbers to demonstrate what we all think and hope is happening. The numbers just aren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t there yet. I hear that the season is going pretty well so far, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s off to a good start.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nLess foot traffic improves the reptiles situation right now, but what will happen when the beaches reopen, and the sea turtles\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 eggs begin to hatch? Leatherback sea turtles will see hatchlings toward the end of April. Godfrey said researchers are working in uncharted territory, and only time will tell.\n\nRELATED STORY:\n\nDr. Justin Perrault, Director of Research at the Loggerhead Marinelife Center, said his team does worry that when the beaches reopen, there may be an influx of people flocking to the beach because they were stuck indoors for an extended period. He added:\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt just depends on the behavior of people after the closures end. And if there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s an excessive amount on the beaches, then more people means more interaction with turtles, which can be negative if they don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t follow the rules.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe city of Jacksonville announced beaches and parks in Duval County would open Friday with certain restrictions starting at 5 pm, according to the city\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Twitter page.\n\nPerrault said when people do return, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll be essential for them to to keep lights off whenever possible, maintain distance from marine animals, and leave the beach the way they found it. He added:\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faRemember that we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not the only species out there.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nSOURCE:\n\nShares"

Andrew Cuomo\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4s March 25 directive after the New York State Health Department declined to release the figures gleaned from its internal survey, conducted two weeks ago.\n\nThe health department is still verifying \u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00faincomplete\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f9 data.\n\nAccording to critics, the directive, which had been intended to help free up hospital beds for the sickest patients as cases surged, instead only helped speed up the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus in the mentioned establishments, in addition to placing an additional burden on already overwhelmed facilities.\n\n\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00faA number of nursing homes have felt constrained by the order and admitted hospital discharged patients without knowing what their COVID status was,\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f9 said Chris Laxton, executive director of the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.\n\nAccording to numbers posted by New York\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4s Department of Health, the state\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nursing home COVID-19 death toll stood well over 5,000 as of this writing, making it a significant chunk of the state\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4s total running death toll from the virus.\n\nThe directive, which also noted that the state\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4s nursing homes and related facilities cannot refuse patients, was reversed on May 10.\n\nFollowing intense criticism, Cuomo, in his subsequent media briefings, said he was merely following recommendations set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nNo matter how much Cuomo spins the said directive however, Stuart Almer, a nursing home operator, said it cannot be denied that the state order still put staff and residents at great risk.\n\n\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00faWe can\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4t draw a straight line from bringing in someone positive to someone catching the disease, but we\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4re talking about elderly, fragile and vulnerable residents,\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f9 Almer stated in an interview with AP.

We knew the most vulnerable were in nursing homes and rehab centers,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Arbeeny said, citing studies that pointed to the elderly and immunocompromised as being the most likely to succumb to the virus.\n\nFormer New York lieutenant governor and Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths founder Betsy McCaughey did not mince words when speaking about the current situation in the state\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4s nursing homes.\n\n\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00faThey\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f4re death pits,\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00f9 McCaughey told The New York Times.\n\n\u221a\u00a2\u00ac\u00c4\u00ac\u00faThese nursing homes are already overwhelmed.

                    "article_content": "Maurie Backman\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis has done extensive damage to the U.S. economy already, and the longer it drags on, the tougher our recovery is apt to be. But as difficult as things have been for individuals, the companies that employ them have been thrust into a very tricky set of circumstances, too.\n\nThe good news? Most workers are pleased with the way their employers have handled things in light of COVID-19, according to a recent survey by Workfest powered by Zenefits, an HR software company. Specifically, 67% of employees believe their employers genuinely care about their well-being and have taken steps to make that clear during the pandemic. And 74% think their employers took the right precautions to ensure employee safety during the crisis.\n\nGo to the mall?:Simon Property Group reopening more malls as more states reopen from coronavirus shutdown\n\nWalmart & Sam's Club:Retailers giving hourly employees coronavirus cash bonuses worth $390M in June\n\nA big part of protecting employees boils down to clear communication, and in this regard, 68% of employees agree that their employers have stepped up. But despite all of this positive news, workers remain concerned about their jobs.\n\nSpecifically, 51% of employees surveyed are anxious about their employment status given the state of the economy. And about half of workers think that the companies they work for won't last longer than three months without some type of financial assistance, or without the economy being able to open back up.\n\nIf you're worried about losing your job in the course of the ongoing crisis, you're clearly not alone. Here are four steps to take if that's a major concern.\n\n1. Talk to your employer\n\nYour employer may have more financial reserves than you'd expect. Before you spend sleepless nights worrying about a potential layoff, have an honest conversation with your boss. Express that you're concerned about losing your job and ask for a realistic view of where things stand in that regard. Your boss may tell you that your department is last on the chopping block, which could help you breathe easier. Or you may learn that your worries are legitimate, in which case having that knowledge can help you prepare for a layoff accordingly.\n\n2. Assess your savings\n\nPart of the reason so many Americans are struggling financially right now is that they don't have cash reserves in the bank. But if you have a healthy level of emergency savings, you may be in a stronger position to ride out a layoff should that come to be. Look at your savings balance and compare it to what your expenses entail. You may get some peace of mind if you see that you can easily cover three or four months' worth of bills without having to resort to a backup plan.\n\n3. Read up on unemployment benefits\n\nGenerally speaking, you're entitled to unemployment benefits if you lose your job through no fault of your own. These days, unemployment benefits are more generous than they've been in the past. As part of the COVID-19 relief package that was passed in March, you're now entitled to an extra $600 a week in addition to your regular unemployment benefit. This holds true even if that $600 boost results in a raise. Unemployment has also been extended by 13 weeks, which means you may be entitled to up to 39 weeks of benefits.\n\n4. Figure out what you'll do about health insurance\n\nYou may have a decent chunk of cash in emergency savings, and you may be entitled to a respectable unemployment benefit should your job be taken away. But what about health insurance? At a time like this, you can't afford to not have coverage, so spend some time researching your options. You may be able to retain your existing insurance, albeit at a cost. Or your employer may agree to extend your coverage for a while and subsidize your premiums. It's certainly worth having that conversation.\n\nThough it's encouraging to see that most employees think their employers have handled the ongoing crisis well, that doesn't negate the fear of losing their jobs. If you're worried about layoffs, take the above steps. The more information you gather, the more empowered you'll feel at a time when so much uncertainty abounds.\n\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

                    "article_content": "As coronavirus outbreaks continue to ravage long-term care centers across the state, a strike has been averted for 6,000 nursing home workers who threatened a work stoppage at 64 facilities starting Friday.\n\nThe workers, members of SEIU Healthcare Illinois, announced a tentative agreement Thursday on a two-year contract that includes a $15 minimum wage for all workers, hazard pay during the pandemic, additional sick days and provisions ensuring that employees are not required to work without adequate equipment to protect themselves from the virus.\n\nDuring a virtual news conference Thursday, Greg Kelley, president of SEIU Healthcare Illinois Indiana Missouri & Kansas, noted that nursing homes have become \u201a\u00c4\u00fahotspots\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 where COVID-19 has spread rapidly and said the agreement will help \u201a\u00c4\u00fasafeguard the safety\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of both the workers and residents.\n\nFrancine Rico, a certified nursing assistant at Villa at Windsor Park in South Shore, told reporters that supplies are still limited at her facility, where 91 staff members and residents have tested positive for the coronavirus. Fifteen of them have died, according to data compiled by the Illinois Department of Public Health.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faOur members are still needing to use gowns and raincoats and use your mask for a week,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Rico.\n\nRep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill, bemoaned essential workers like Rico having to re-use protective gear, faulting the \u201a\u00c4\u00facomplete failure\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 by the federal government to control the supply.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen we call people essential workers \u201a\u00c4\u00ee we say they have to go to work \u201a\u00c4\u00ee then it is really the responsibility in this pandemic that we get them the materials and the protection that they need,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Schakowsky, who has introduced legislation to bolster protections for nursing home residents and workers amid the pandemic. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt is one of the most infuriating, unacceptable things that I have ever heard of.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nSchakowsky noted that 44% of COVID-19 deaths in Illinois are attributable to long-term care facilities and lauded the workers for taking a stand to further protect themselves and their patients.\n\nThe Illinois Association of Health Care Facilities, which represented the nursing homes in negotiations, said: \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhile negotiations have ended, this insidious virus has not. We are grateful a walkout was avoided, and that our heroic staff members will continue caring for our vulnerable seniors as we fight this battle together.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe agreement covers more than 10,000 members of SEIU Healthcare who provide care to residents at more than 100 nursing homes. SEIU Healthcare is an investor in Sun-Times Media.\n\nKelley said he hopes the contract will be ratified by next week."

                    "article_content": "Coronavirus May Mean Lights Out For Summer Camps This Year\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption PeopleImages/E+/Getty Images PeopleImages/E+/Getty Images\n\nSummer camps around the nation are grappling with whether or how they can open this summer, as the pandemic continues. The prospect is especially challenging for overnight camps, where hundreds of kids play, eat and sleep together, and the very idea of social distancing is completely anathema to the camp experience.\n\nLittle wonder a growing number of sleepaway camps have already capitulated to COVID-19.\n\n\"The cancellation of camp this summer is profoundly disappointing for all of us after what already feels like an eternity of frustration and uncertainty,\" wrote Shannon Donovan-Monti, executive director at Chimney Corners Camp in Western Massachusetts, in an email to parents this week. \"There are no words that can take away the heartbreak of depriving our children and ourselves of something that has given us such joy and connection to others.\"\n\nEleven-year old Maddie Prince was among the many Chimney Corners campers who took it hard. \"It makes me sad that I can't be with my friends,\" she said.\n\nCamp is where she \"grows up more,\" she said, and where she is happiest. \"You don't have any tech and it's really easy to forget all of your worries,\" she added.\n\nNational Will Summer Camps Open This Year? Will Summer Camps Open This Year? Listen \u00ac\u2211 4:52 4:52\n\n\"I would argue that kids need camp this summer more than ever before,\" said Dayna Hardin, president of CampGroup, which runs 15 camps from Maine to Michigan, including 13 overnight camps that are still hoping to open. She says the overnight experience might be just what the doctor ordered for kids who have been suffering through months of isolation and anxiety. And she argued that kids may actually be safer from infection at overnight camp than at home.\n\n\"We are looking at this like we are the castle,\" Hardin said. \"Our kids are going to enter the castle and we are going to pull up the drawbridge and we will be our own isolated community.\"\n\nBut a strict \"no in, no out\" policy would certainly crimp camps' style. It would mean no field trips, no visiting days and no socials or sports tournaments with other camps. Staff would have to remain on campus for days off. And laundry and food deliveries would pose challenges.\n\nCamp life inside the \"bubble,\" as some are calling it, would also change. Instead of playing tag, kids would have to fill their time with non-contact activities like making crafts.\n\n\"Camp is going to look very different,\" said Matt Fragala, managing principal consultant at Environmental Health & Engineering, the group hired by the American Camp Association (ACA) to recommend best practices and guidelines for camps. Specifics will depend on state and local mandates, but Fragala said recommendations will include constant disinfecting, spreading kids out for sleeping and eating at a distance and in shifts in the dining hall. The goal, Fragala said, is to \"control some of the mayhem the best way we can. It's going to be a change from business as usual at camp. But there's a balance we have to try to meet to keep everybody safe and to minimize potential risk.\"\n\nCamps are also expecting to have to split kids up into smaller units, said ACA president and CEO Tom Rosenberg. \"These would be like families where [kids] would be able to socialize somewhat normally,\" he said. \"But between the family circles, there will be physical distancing.\"\n\nThe same rule would apply to wearing face masks, according to Rosenberg. Campers would wear them when outside their \"family\" group, he said, and staff who interact with more than one \"family\" group, like a food service worker or an archery instructor, would likely have to wear a mask all day.\n\nCamps would be expected to regularly monitor campers and staff for symptoms of COVID-19, for example by taking temperatures every day. But whether camps would test for COVID-19 is an open question. Some camps see testing as a requirement; they won't even consider opening unless they could test kids before and during the session. But other camps say they would not test, relying on taking campers' temperatures daily and watching for other symptoms. That's an approach some parents find irresponsible.\n\n\"That keeps me up at night,\" said Fina Barouch, a Boston-area physician and parent of two campers. She said she will not allow her kids to go to camp.\n\n\"It only takes one person to be shedding virus when completely asymptomatic, and my concern is that this could turn into something like the nursing home pandemic, where it just spreads exponentially,\" Barouch said.\n\nThe CDC has issued its guidance for camps, recommending general precautions like social distancing, screening and extra disinfecting. The agency also directs camps to follow state and local laws, but in most cases camps are still waiting to hear what those will be, and they're growing increasingly frustrated that they don't have more information to help them make their decision.\n\nA few state and local governments have already decided to ban sleepaway camps this summer, including Georgia and Minnesota, and Connecticut is expected to do so. Officials in Vermont have indicated they want to allow overnight camps to open, with extra precautions that are still being worked out. But the vast majority of jurisdictions are still wrestling with the issue.\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said the issue comes up every day in conversation with other states.\n\n\"The tough part,\" he said, \"is figuring out, especially when it comes to some of the stuff that involves the joys of being a kid, figuring out some way to do this, where you have at least enough rules to make sure it can be done safely, but you don't destroy the whole spontaneous nature of what those are supposed to be about.\"\n\nIndeed, one camp director said an overnight camp that cuts so many core traditions would be like Disney World without the Magic Kingdom or Mickey Mouse.\n\nCamp consultant Lauren Kasnett Nearpass, co-founder of Summer 365, agrees that if the restrictions become so onerous that camp no longer feels like camp, it may no longer be worth it.\n\n\"If you have to remove the magic completely,\" she said, \"if it's going to look and feel so different, then perhaps you know, we just power forward to 2021.\"\n\nThe prospect of a watered-down camp experience gives pause even to die-hard campers like 15-year-old twins Sasha and Amanda Fine, who were looking forward to the perks and privileges they would enjoy as members of the oldest bunk at their camp this summer.\n\n\"Trust me, I want camp more than anyone,\" said Sasha. \"It's just that we can't have camp like this. Like it's taunting us.\"\n\nA month ago, Amanda said, her friends were all in favor of going to camp this summer no matter what. But now, she said, rather than a heavily compromised and shortened 2020, most would rather wait and have a \"normal\" summer in 2021."

                    "article_content": "Submitted by InfoBrics, authored by Johanna Ross, journalist based in Edinburgh, Scotland\u201a\u00c4\u00b6\n\nAs lockdown restrictions begin to be lifted, and we slowly aim to return to \u201a\u00c4\u00f2normality\u201a\u00c4\u00f4, questions are beginning to be asked about just what that normality should be. For never in recent history has a crisis so blatantly highlighted the inequalities in our society. And it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not just those on the left that think so. Veteran right-wing journalist Max Hastings, recently wrote a piece in which he said the coronavirus pandemic unleashed a demand for \u201a\u00c4\u00f2social, political and economic reform unprecedented in our memories\u201a\u00c4\u00f4. Even the former governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, recently admitted that when this is over, it would be \u201a\u00c4\u00f2reasonable\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 for people to \u201a\u00c4\u00f2demand improvements\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 in the quality of social provision and healthcare.\n\nThe reality is that Covid-19 has turned capitalists into socialists overnight, whether they like it or not. We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve kept hearing about governments making the choice between people and the economy. But people are the economy. Fundamentally, we need a change in priorities. The danger is that we return to a status quo from which another crisis will be born: this pandemic is not over yet, the threat of another one in future is real, and we need to have the social measures in place to enable us to deal with the fallout. Britain only has to compare itself statistically with other nations to realize that, along with the US, it has suffered particularly badly so far from this disease, and we have to ask why. An under-funded healthcare system, together with a 20% poverty rate surely plays a role.\n\nIn the midst of this \u201a\u00c4\u00f2war\u201a\u00c4\u00f4, with unemployment set to skyrocket, and families struggling to pay the rent and feed their children, Jeremy Corbyn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s agenda at the last election looks appealing. The renationalisation of key industries, a \u201a\u00c4\u00f2living\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 wage, a massive social housing programme, and immediate pay rise for public sector workers; somehow it doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t seem so \u201a\u00c4\u00f2radical\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 after all. The latest figures show that people living in poorer areas in Britain are twice as likely to succumb to coronavirus. What is the government doing about it? Not much. One of the Tory pledges in their 2019 election manifesto was to add five years on to life expectancy by 2035. But that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a tall order and would mean a significant change in policies \u201a\u00c4\u00ec not just in the short term for dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic \u201a\u00c4\u00ec but in the long term. We may be the world\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s fifth largest economy but Britain is currently ranked 29th in the global life expectancy index, behind a host of European countries.\n\nThe question is, what kind of post-Covid-19 future do we want? Already comparisons are being made with the aftermath of the Depression and the Second World War. After the Depression, President Roosevelt stated that \u201a\u00c4\u00f2heedless self-interest is\u201a\u00c4\u00b6bad economics\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 and that \u201a\u00c4\u00f2freedom from want\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 must be a key factor in policy-making. As for the UK, war-time leader Winston Churchill\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Conservative party was rejected in the 1945 election in favour of Labour, whose manifesto brandished the slogan \u201a\u00c4\u00f2The Labour party is a Socialist party and proud of it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4. The policies on which the party won were radical: nationalisation of the Bank of England, the coal and energy industries, public transport, and iron and steel. During the war, inequality was laid bare much in the same way as it has been during this current pandemic, and we saw the 1942 Beveridge report published, which laid the foundation for the welfare state \u201a\u00c4\u00ec the cornerstone of British society as we know it today.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00f2Goodbye globalisation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 read the front cover of this week\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Economist. It argues that globalisation was already on the rocks after the 2008 financial crash and Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s war with China; Covid-19 has been the final nail in the coffin. It predicts that global trade faces a troubling time ahead as governments, forced to underwrite national firms, will continue to favour them moving forward. But this can only be welcomed. Firstly, global trade generally means rich countries exploiting cheap workers abroad. Aside from welfare, a return to \u201a\u00c4\u00f2normality\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 would be disastrous for the planet. Satellite images have shown the remarkable changes which have taken place in our atmosphere across the globe as lockdowns were imposed on an international scale. Carbon dioxide emissions are set to have fallen this year by 8%, but this would have to occur every year for a decade in order to limit global warming to less than 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures.\n\nObviously, repeated and prolonged lockdown is not a solution, but some serious attempt must be made to address climate change before it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s too late. The coronavirus pandemic illustrates just how mother nature can floor us before we know it. She can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be underestimated. Indeed there has been something wonderful about the way nature has been able to reclaim its territory in this short time, with social media packed with viral videos of wild animals roaming the empty streets of our metropolises without a care in the world. It could be imagination, but somehow even the trees and bushes seem more green and luscious at this time.\n\nSo while governments take their first steps back towards \u201a\u00c4\u00f2normality\u201a\u00c4\u00f4, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s vital that, as a race, we don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t. This is a pivotal moment in our history, when the world is on pause, that we can think about what kind of future we want for our grandchildren, instead of being completely at the mercy of business, blindly bashing on, maximizing profit at whatever the cost. As William Beveridge proclaimed back in 1942 \u201a\u00c4\u00faA revolutionary moment in the world\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s history is a time for revolutions, not for patching.\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\n\nLiked it?

But Russian President Vladimir Putin believes there may be more pain ahead.\n\nAccording to Putin, the virus may once again begin to spread widely from October to November. During a meeting to discuss the epidemiological situation in Russia, he said the country needs to be ready for a second wave later in the year.\n\nPutin added that the removal of the present restrictions in Russia must be guided by science. However, he also asked officials to prepare recommendations for dealing with the consequences of the pandemic, especially the economic repercussions.\n\nAlso on rt.com Normal life in Moscow will resume ONLY after 60% of residents have Covid-19 immunity \u201a\u00c4\u00ec official\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIn order to gradually emerge from restrictions with which we still live to a large extent today, we need to think about what the experts here and their colleagues abroad are talking about, that another wave may possibly come in the fall,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Putin warned.\n\nMoscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin insisted that he feels obliged to maintain the current lockdown in the capital, including the system of self-isolation and the control of movement using digital passes.

                    "article_content": "SPRINGFIELD \u201a\u00c4\u00ee With the pandemic now nearing its fourth month in Illinois, most residents have made up their minds on whether to wear masks or other face coverings, but two downstate Republicans say they need a few days to think it over.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt boils down, in my book, to a matter of personal choice,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said state Rep. Brad Halbrook, R-Shelbyville.\n\nThat declaration of personal choice could soon be put to the test.\n\nThat\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s because next week the Illinois Legislature is scheduled to return to session for the first time since March 5, but that return is not without some changes. Notably, the Illinois House will meet at the Bank of Springfield Center, and legislators will be asked to wear face masks, submit to COVID-19 tests and temperature checks and adhere to social distancing measures.\n\nMulling an about-face, Halbrook and fellow Republican state Rep. Darren Bailey of downstate Xenia said they won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t commit to wearing masks when the House meets on Wednesday, potentially creating a standoff between them and Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan.\n\nPublic health officials, including those at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommend people wear cloth face coverings in \u201a\u00c4\u00fapublic settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 not only to prevent themselves from getting sick but also to prevent someone from unknowingly contracting the virus and spreading it to others.\n\nAnd on Friday, Republican House Leader Jim Durkin urged GOP legislators to abide by those rules.\n\nBut Bailey, who is suing Gov. J.B. Pritzker over the Chicago Democrat\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s stay-at-home order, said he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not concerned about contracting COVID-19 and that House members who are should stay away from Springfield next week.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faSo, if you are concerned about your health then, by all means, you should stay home or you wear a mask,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Bailey said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf someone doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want to wear a mask, then they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re simply taking the risk themselves.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nHalbrook said he is concerned that wearing a face covering could have negative health consequences for him. While Halbrook did not say whether he had an underlying health condition that could prevent him from wearing a mask, he said he wants to meet with his primary care doctor before he makes that decision.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI need to understand one-on-one with a professional what the dangers are, what is the upside, what\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the downside,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Halbrook said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI just want to have that conversation, and I have not been able to get to that person to have that conversation. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m just trying to make a well-informed decision.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nFor weeks, Republicans called for the General Assembly return, but it was only after Pritzker joined that chorus that fellow Democrats Madigan and Senate President Don Harmon agreed.\n\nIn a letter to Durkin announcing the return to Springfield, Madigan wrote that he was asking House members to follow \u201a\u00c4\u00faapproved precautions\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 from the Illinois Department of Public Health, which included wearing a face mask.\n\nWith Bailey and Halbrook as potential holdouts, Durkin sent a letter his GOP caucus on Friday asking members to \u201a\u00c4\u00faabide by best practices and safety protocols put forth by the Illinois Department of Public Health, which include temperature checks and wearing a protective mask.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe have a duty to not only uphold the Constitution but to also protect the health and well-being of our citizens and that includes our staff, House personnel, our colleagues, their families and members of the public,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the Western Springs Republican wrote.\n\nBailey and Halbrook are the first two Republicans to object.\n\nIn response, state Rep. Emanuel \u201a\u00c4\u00faChris\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Welch, D-Hillside, took to Twitter to call for the downstate Republicans and any other House members who refuse to wear face coverings to be \u201a\u00c4\u00fabanned from entering the convention center.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faYour intentional, reckless act to ignore the face mask guidance will risk lives. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m aware of members in our caucus and your caucus with newborns at home,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Welch tweeted.\n\nWhether any bare-faced legislators will be barred from the Bank of Springfield Center remains to be seen.\n\nMadigan spokesman Steve Brown wouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t say whether the guidelines spelled out by the Southwest Side Democrat will be enforced, only that \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe remain very hopeful that all members respect their colleagues and staff.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9"

As a result, the ruble lost some 20 percent of its value \u201a\u00c4\u00ec not as much as it could have given the fact that oil prices had shrunk almost threefold. According to the calculations of Gazprombank analysts, without foreign exchange interventions the dollar by the beginning of May would have been worth over 110 rubles.\n\n\u00ac\u00a9 Sputnik / Alexandr Demyanchuk Gazprombank logo in the pavilion hosting the 19th St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. (File)\n\nIn April, the value of the Russian central bank\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gold reserves grew by $6.244 billion, or 5.2 percent, reaching a value equivalent of over $126 billion, or 21.3 percent of the bank\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s total reserves, according to figures released by the regulator.\n\nPartly triggered by bullion\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s growing worth as a stable store of value amid the global economic slump, the soaring gold stocks caused total reserves to grow by 0.45 percent in the month of April, reaching a total of $566 billion.\n\nThe past four months have witnessed Russian reserves overall growing a net 2.1 percent.\n\nThe Russian Central Bank\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s international reserves, consisting of bullion, foreign currency reserves and special drawing rights assets, form a \u201a\u00c4\u00farainy day\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 investment fund for the Russian government.\n\nAccording to the World Gold Council (WGC), in 2018 Russia bought 274.3 tons of gold, in 2019 - 158.1, and so far in 2020 - 28 tons.\n\nThis week, gold has been trading at its highest since October 2012, at $1,764.55.\n\nIn global markets on 21 May, Gold eased 1 percent to $1,732.43 per ounce, while US gold futures shed 1.1 percent to $1,733.60 per ounce.\n\n\"Gold seems to have lost a little momentum since breaking above $1,750 and the rise in the dollar today doesn't seem to be helping,\" OANDA analyst Craig Erlam was cited as saying by Reuters.\n\nAnalysts are convinced this is not the limit, as precious metal is the most reliable investment tool in a crisis.\n\nThe developments come as investor confidence in US government bonds has been rapidly declining, with yields on the bonds stalling near all-time lows.\n\n\u00ac\u00a9 AP Photo / Patrick Semansky The U.S. Treasury Department building at dusk, Thursday, June 6, 2019, in Washington.\n\nAccording to Treasury Department data cited by the outlet on 15 May, foreign investors sold a record amount of US Treasury bonds and notes for the month of March.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt was a pretty large liquidation from a lot of the foreign accounts. And it makes a lot of sense because there was a lot of precautionary liquidation given all the uncertainty, especially in emerging market economies,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates analyst at TD Securities in New York was quoted as saying.\n\nForeigners were cited as selling $299.346 billion in Treasuries in March, a record high, compared with foreign buying of $4.885 billion in February.\n\nIn March, Saudi Arabia was one of the biggest sellers of Treasuries, with its holdings sinking to $159.1 billion, from $184.4 billion in February.\n\nThe Bank of Russia, which back in 2018 rapidly sold off the vast majority of its stash of US treasury bonds on the market, has slashed the remainder threefold - from $12.58 billion to $3.85 billion.\n\nThis represents less than one percent of the country's international reserves."

                    "article_content": "When I was growing up in the US during the 1960\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s, 1970\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s and 1980\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s, one of the prized freedoms we often and repeatedly talked about was the right to pray to God as one understands God, to be free both to go to the church of your church and to be free from going to the national church by requirement. Sure, this led to a pluralistic society, and sure, there are major challenges for each faith group in competition with other such groups and with the predominant secularism in the US, but believers have always had the freedom to pray and worship as they like.\n\nUntil now.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic brought in a wide series of restrictions against gathering in public places all over the world. In our own series on the rightness or wrongness of Orthodox Christian places of worship closing due to government regulations, we noted that the restriction on religious worship is not particularly directed at Christians only. Mecca is closed, the Indian, Japanese and some Jewish religious activities have all shown the effects of COVID-19 prevention regimes.\n\nHowever, in the United States, we now have elected leaders violating the principles set forth in the Constitution, namely, the very first Amendment:\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faCongress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free excercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nInstead, we have governors ordering churches closed, people fined and even arrested for going, and in places like Mississippi, the sentiment against Christian churchgoers has turned particularly nasty. A parish was burned to the ground, acccording to The New York Times:\n\nThe burning of a church in northern Mississippi this week is being investigated as arson because of a spray-painted message at the scene that seemed to criticize the church\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s defiance of coronavirus restrictions. First Pentecostal Church had sued the city of Holly Springs, Miss., which is about an hour southeast of Memphis, arguing that its stay-at-home order had violated the church\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s right to free speech and interfered with its members\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 ability to worship. After firefighters put out the blaze early Wednesday, the police found a message, \u201a\u00c4\u00faBet you stay home now you hypokrits,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 spray-painted on the ground near the church\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s doors, according to Maj. Kelly McMillen of the Marshall County Sheriff\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Department. A photograph of the graffiti also appears to show an atomic symbol with an \u201a\u00c4\u00faA\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in the center, which is sometimes used as a logo for atheist groups.\n\nOne thing this clearly proves is that bigots cannot spell correctly.\n\nBut it also proves there is a great deal of animosity against Christians. This kind of attack would not have taken place even ten years ago, but now the anti-Christian climate in the United States is such that incidents like this are looking for ways to happen.\n\nThis video shows how embedded anti-Christian attitudes are now in the press corps at the White House. Watch as Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany deftly and forcefully handles the ferocious accusations that go beyond First Amendment sensibilities.\n\nOn Friday, May 22nd, President Trump called on state governments to allow churches to open, and has also threatened to override any state that refuses to do so. Here is what he said, with emphasis added:\n\nThank you very much. At my direction, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is issuing guidance for communities of faith. I want to thank Dr. Redfield and the CDC for their work on this matter and all the other work they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been doing over the past what now seems like a long period of time. Today I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m identifying houses of worship, churches, synagogue and mosques as essential places that provide essential services. Some governors have deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential, but have left out churches and other houses of worship. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not right. So I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential. I call upon governors to allow our churches and places of worship to open right now. If there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s any question, they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to have to call me, but they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not going to be successful in that call. These are places that hold our society together and keep our people united. The people are demanding to go to church and synagogue, go to their mosque. Many millions of Americans embrace worship as an essential part of life. The ministers, pastors, rabbis, imams and other faith leaders will make sure that their congregations are safe as they gather and pray. I know them well. They love their congregations. They love their people. They don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want anything bad to happen to them or to anybody else. The governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important, essential places of faith to open right now for this weekend. If they don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t do it, I will override the governors. In America, we need more prayer, not less. Thank you very much. Thank you.\n\nPresident Trump has this basic point right: without prayer to God, our nation is sunk. And it is, indeed, amazing how vile and anti-Christian our supposed \u201a\u00c4\u00fabest and brightest\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 have turned out to be. Incidentally, the press and \u201a\u00c4\u00faExperts\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 are saying that the president has no power to make this stick. They are wrong. In the spirit of the First Amendment, he absolutely does have the power to make this order stick.\n\nLiked it?

                    "article_content": "Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s measures of success. But after a manic 3\u00ac\u03a9 years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.\n\nBy far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not going to play that game,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not uniform across states and across countries.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBut even beyond the death count, there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the official said.\n\nSome Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t been able to focus on getting the response right.\n\nTrump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSo it is a war and I define victory when it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said on May 1. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt can never be a total victory because too many people have died.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nWhen American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.\n\nOthers are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAllowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 argued one Republican close to the president.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sen. Lindsey Graham\n\nBut, he added, \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf things don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t look like they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re bouncing back by September, I think that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to be a problem.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe fear that Trump can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.\n\nWhen asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the \u201a\u00c4\u00faeconomic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nA spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.\n\nOthers are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)"

The Chicago area case was confirmed at Advocate Children\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Hospital, though it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unclear whether the child is being treated at the Oak Lawn or Park Ridge campus.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThis appears to be a very complex complication of COVID-19,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Dr. Frank Belmonte, the hospital\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s chief medical officer. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are currently learning new things about this virus every day. This is the first indication that children may be more negatively impacted than we first expected.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe mysterious sickness was first identified in children in Europe and is now beginning to crop up in the United States, according to a statement from Advocate, which noted that the illness has affected \u201a\u00c4\u00fachildren as young as two and well into the teens.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nIn New York, public health officials have identified 64 children with symptoms consistent with the illness. A bulletin issued Monday warned that diagnostic testing for COVID-19 could come back positive or negative and that cases may require both cardiac and respiratory support.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faEarly diagnosis and treatment are essential,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Belmonte. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf you have questions, you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll want to call your pediatrician, or in more serious cases, go to a pediatric emergency department.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9"

You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)\n\nH.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.\n\nH.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of \u201a\u00c4\u00fatesting and contact tracers\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to be sent directly to everyone\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state \u201a\u00c4\u00fafor other purposes,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 such as \u201a\u00c4\u00fasupport the quarantine of such contacts.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined \u201a\u00c4\u00fanational COVID health emergency.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real \"teeth\" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.\n\nIn light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.\n\nEligible recipients of funds include \u201a\u00c4\u00fafaith-based\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00faschool-based\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.\n\nWhat is Contract Tracing?\n\nTake a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.\n\nContract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:\n\nThe disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called \u201a\u00c4\u00fapositive cases\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called \u201a\u00c4\u00faconfirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 require no viral testing, and only \u201a\u00c4\u00fasuspicion of infection.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.\n\nIf contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of \u201a\u00c4\u00fapublic health safety,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new \u201a\u00c4\u00fawar on terror,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or \u201a\u00c4\u00fasecond\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 or \u201a\u00c4\u00fathird\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.\n\nSo, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, \u201a\u00c4\u00faNATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.\n\nPlease take a strong action today by using the health freedom advocacy portal and campaign on Stand For Health Freedom, or use the widget below."

He explains that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the inflammation sparked by the Coronavirus, not the virus itself, that kills patients. Inflammation causes a condition called Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which damages the lungs so that patients, suffering fever, fatigue, and the sense that their inner chest is on fire, eventually cannot breathe without the help of a ventilator.\n\nThe University of Wisconsin in Madison has included intravenous Vitamin C as part of its treatment guideline. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s part of a combination therapy protocol developed in 2017 by Dr. Paul E. Marik at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk. Dr. Marik gives critically ill patients inexpensive, readily available intravenous doses of hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, and thiamine (\u201a\u00c4\u00faHAT\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 therapy) within 6 hours of entering an emergency room. In Dr. Marik\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s study, published in 2017 in the journal \u201a\u00c4\u00faChest\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 by the American College of Chest Physicians, his team reported that in the first 47 patients treated with HAT therapy the death rate was 8.5% compared to 40.4% in patients not treated with HAT. Further, in a recent study by Dr. Kory\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s team involving a large series of patients suffering septic shock, including many with pneumonia, they found that early IV administration of these same vitamins and steroids was critical to survival. The risk of mortality increased with each 6 hours of delay.\n\nWhen the Coronavirus pandemic hit China, Chinese doctors were quick to use intravenous Vitamin C. When their patients tested positive for COVID-19, the Chinese added 2 inexpensive, FDAapproved drugs hydroxychloroquine (anti-malarial) and zithromax (antibiotic) to the IV and gave patients oral doses of 2 supplements: melatonin and zinc. The combination likely worked given that their reported mortality rates are lower than reported elsewhere in the world The link to the Shanghai expert consensus on comprehensive care for COVID-19 patients is attached. The Chinese tried to do a clinical trial of IV Vitamin C, but Dr. Richard Z.Cheng, working with the investigators in Shanghai told Dr. Marik that it was very difficult to get patients to enter the trial. However, of the first 50 patients treated, no-one died!\n\nWhen COVID-19 cases hit Virginia, Dr. Marik used his full HAT protocol (IV hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, thiamine) on ARDS patients in the ICU, while also adding the drugs and supplements used by the Chinese. The results have been remarkable. He recently saved four COVID-19 patients, including an 86-year old man with heart disease who was admitted to the hospital on 100% oxygen, by using the protocol. (86-year old men with heart disease do not normally survive COVID-19!)\n\nDr. Joseph Varon at United General Hospital in Houston, Texas, is using the protocol and, to date, has saved 16 lives. He reports that they are getting off the ventilator in 48 hours instead of 10 - 21 days! That means far fewer hospital beds and ventilators needed \u201a\u00c4\u00ee as well as fewer coffins.\n\nThe big question is: Why aren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t many more U.S. hospitals adopting this protocol? \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe only reason I can give is that there is widespread, and often well-founded, bias amongst physicians against the use of vitamin therapy,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 says Dr. Kory. He adds, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe persistence of this bias is inexplicable given that the evidence is in plain sight.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 He points out that despite the publication of a major study of intravenous Vitamin C in ARDS (the syndrome that is killing patients with COVID-19), which reported dramatic reductions in mortality, days on the ventilator, and days in the ICU, only a minority of critical care doctors adopted the therapy as part of routine practice.\n\nOne hospital chain disallowed the use of steroids in the treatment of COVID-19. That's because doctors are taught that steroids increase the growth of viruses and that steroids harm patients with influenza. Drs. Marik, Varon, and Kory all agree that, for this reason, steroids should not be given early to a patient with influenza or coronavirus. But Dr. Kory says evidence does not show harm of steroids in previous coronavirus epidemics such as SARS and MERS, especially when given late inthe disease. When the diagnosis is COVID-19, and especially when the inflammatory response begins to cause deterioration in breathing or the need for a ventilator, steroids should be added. Thesteroids are in the formula to fight the life-threatening inflammation. In fact, all of the formula\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ingredients are needed, together, to get maximum life-saving results.\n\nNew York Internist Dr. Keith Berkowitz adds that, \u201a\u00c4\u00fain this time of crisis, when ventilators are in limited supply, hospitals are overwhelmed with patients, and medical staff lack adequate protective gear and are putting their lives on the line, every hospital needs to try this safe, low-cost and highly effective treatment that leading specialists know saves lives in acute respiratory distress syndrome. This is not the time to wait months for a vaccine or years for more test results. The important thing now is to keep patients off ventilators and to save lives. Period.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9"

The agency noted that they do not have any specific safety concerns about the product, but said that they still needed to do some research to ensure that the tests were safe.\n\nThe program in question is known as the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network (SCAN) and they are now being asked to put their operation on hold until proper authorization is obtained. This also means that patients who have already sent in their tests will not be able to receive their results until the authorization has been given. SCAN is promising that this shut down is only temporary.\n\nSCAN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s website stated that, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe FDA has not raised any concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of SCAN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s test, but we have been asked to pause testing until we receive that additional authorization.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nSCAN was sending out free test kits to potential patients, including people who were asymptomatic, hoping to obtain some data on how the coronavirus spreads through people who don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t show symptoms.\n\ntake our poll - story continues below Trump or Biden, who will win?

The United States has been slow to get started with mass testing, especially of asymptomatic individuals, and the tests are mostly controlled by government agencies like the CDC. The tests currently available have also been criticized for being inaccurate. Just last week, the FDA issued a warning about tests made by Abbott Laboratories, saying that they often gave falsely negative results.\n\nJohn Vibes is an author and journalist who takes a special interest in the counter culture, and focuses solutions-oriented approaches to social problems.

If H.R. 6666 passes, real \"teeth\" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.\n\nIn light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.\n\nEligible recipients of funds include \u201a\u00c4\u00fafaith-based\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00faschool-based\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.\n\nWhat is Contract Tracing?\n\nTake a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.\n\nContract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:\n\nThe disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called \u201a\u00c4\u00fapositive cases\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called \u201a\u00c4\u00faconfirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 require no viral testing, and only \u201a\u00c4\u00fasuspicion of infection.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.\n\nIf contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of \u201a\u00c4\u00fapublic health safety,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new \u201a\u00c4\u00fawar on terror,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or \u201a\u00c4\u00fasecond\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 or \u201a\u00c4\u00fathird\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.\n\nSo, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, \u201a\u00c4\u00faNATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.\n\nPlease take a strong action today by using the health freedom advocacy portal and campaign on Stand For Health Freedom, or use the widget below."

                    "article_content": "After Alameda County health officials cautioned Tesla against reopening its California car factory yesterday, CEO Elon Musk tweeted today that the company would sue the county and move its headquarters out of state. Hours later, Tesla\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attorneys filed suit in US District Court in the Northern District of California seeking an injunction against the county\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s shelter-in-place order, because it \u201a\u00c4\u00facontradicts the Governor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Order to the extent it restricts the operation of business operating in the federal critical infrastructure sectors.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faTesla is filing a lawsuit against Alameda County immediately,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Musk said on Twitter. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe unelected & ignorant \u201a\u00c4\u00f2interim Health Officer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 of Alameda is acting contrary to the Governor, the President, our Constitutional freedoms & just plain common sense!\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nMusk has been a vocal critic of coronavirus shelter-in-place orders, saying at the company\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s April 29th earnings call that such restrictions were \u201a\u00c4\u00fafascist\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and not democratic. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are a bit worried about not being able to resume production in the Bay Area, and that should be identified as a serious risk,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Musk said. He also urged supporters on Twitter to \u201a\u00c4\u00faplease voice your disagreement as strongly as possible with Alameda County.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nAn Alameda County spokesperson said in a statement to The Verge on Saturday that the county Health Care Services Agency and Public Health Department have been \u201a\u00c4\u00facommunicating directly and working closely with the Tesla team on the ground in Fremont. This has been a collaborative, good faith effort to develop and implement a safety plan that allows for reopening while protecting the health and well-being of the thousands of employees who travel to and from work at Tesla\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s factory.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe spokesperson added that the team at Tesla had been responsive to guidance and recommendations \u201a\u00c4\u00faand we look forward to coming to an agreement on an appropriate safety plan very soon.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 The statement, issued several hours after Musk\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s tweets, did not reference the Tesla CEO\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s comments or mention him by name.\n\nFrankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA. \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 9, 2020\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe appreciate that our residents and businesses have made tremendous sacrifices and that together we have been able to save lives and protect community health in our region,\u201a\u00c4\u00fa the statement continues. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt is our collective responsibility to move through the phases of reopening and loosening the restrictions of the Shelter-in-Place Order in the safest way possible, guided by data and science.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nTesla announced plans to resume \u201a\u00c4\u00falimited operations\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 at its Fremont facility yesterday, which would bring back about 30 percent of its workforce. But officials in Alameda County, where Fremont is located, said yesterday that it was still under a shelter-in-place order and that Tesla it didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t meet its criteria to reopen. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe have not said that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s appropriate to move forward,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Erica Pan, Alameda County\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s health officer, according to Bloomberg.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom said Thursday that state-level guidance allowing manufacturing to resume some production didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t supersede county-level restrictions. The company had unsucessfully tried to argue that Tesla\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s production should be considered critical infrastructure.\n\nThe Fremont plant, where Tesla assembles its Model 3, Model S, Model X, and Model Y vehicles, was temporarily closed March 23rd to comply with the shelter-in-place order. Tesla reduced pay for all its US salaried employees as of April 13th and put most hourly workers who can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t work remotely on unpaid furlough. What would happen to the roughly 10,000 workers at the Fremont plant if Tesla were to move operations out of state as Musk tweeted, was unclear.\n\nBoth Tesla and Musk settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2018 over Musk\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s tweets about taking Tesla private. Then, in 2019, the terms of the settlement were renegotiated. Under the new terms, a company lawyer must approve Musk\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s tweets about certain parts of Tesla\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s business before Musk sends them. That includes any announcement that would trigger a filing of the form 8-K, which is used for announcing unscheduled material events, to the SEC. As of this writing, Tesla has not filed an 8-K about Musk\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s proposed factory move.\n\nTesla did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nUPDATE May 9th, 5:16PM ET: Adds statement from Alameda County spokesperson and includes additional tweet from Musk.\n\nUPDATE May 9th, 5:40PM ET: Adds details of Tesla lawsuit filed against Alameda County"

                    "article_content": "HOUSTON \u201a\u00c4\u00ee As families marked Mother\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Day in a time of social distancing and isolation due to the coronavirus pandemic, leaders balanced optimism they could loosen lockdowns that have left millions unemployed against the threat of a second wave of infections.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin predicted the American economy would rebound in the second half of this year from unemployment rates that rival the Great Depression. Another 3.2 million U.S. workers applied for jobless benefits last week, bringing the total over the last seven weeks to 33.5 million.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI think you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to see a bounce-back from a low standpoint,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Mnuchin, speaking on \u201a\u00c4\u00faFox News Sunday.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBut the director of the University of Washington institute that created a White House-endorsed coronavirus model said the moves by states to re-open businesses \u201a\u00c4\u00fawill translate into more cases and deaths in 10 days from now.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Dr. Christopher Murray of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation said states where cases and deaths are going up more than expected include Illinois, Arizona, Florida and California.\n\nMany families faced their first Mother\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Day without loved ones lost in the pandemic. Others sent good wishes from a safe distance or through phone and video calls.\n\nThe virus has caused particular suffering for the elderly, with more than 26,000 deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, according to an Associated Press tally.\n\nAt a senior center in Smyrna, Georgia, 73-year-old Mary Washington spoke to her daughter Courtney Crosby and grandchild Sydney Crosby through a window.\n\nIn Grafton, West Virginia, where the tradition of Mother\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Day began 112 years ago, the brick building now known as the International Mother\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Day Shrine held its first online-only audience. Anna Jarvis first held a memorial service for her mother and all mothers on the second Sunday of May in 1908.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faSheltered safely at home with the family together would be viewed by Anna Jarvis as exactly the way she wanted Mother\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Day to be observed,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Marvin Gelhausen, chairman of the shrine\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s board of trustees, in an address on YouTube.\n\nMatilda Cuomo, the mother of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, called into her son\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s daily briefing so he and his three daughters could wish her a happy Mother\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Day.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI am so blessed as many mothers today are,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 she said.\n\nAndrew Cuomo, whose state is the deadliest hot spot for the virus in the U.S., said he looked forward to getting back to normal. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to have fun, and then you can spend more time with me. I know I am your favorite,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said in a playful dig at his siblings.\n\nHe also announced two policy reversals a day after an Associated Press report in which residents\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 relatives, watchdog groups and politicians from both parties alleged he was not doing enough to counter the surge of deaths in nursing homes, where about 5,300 residents have died. Nursing home staff in New York will now have to undergo COVID-19 tests twice a week and facilities will no longer be required to take in hospital patients who were infected.\n\nThe U.S. has seen 1.3 million infections and nearly 80,000 deaths, the most in the world by far, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Worldwide, 4 million people have been reported infected and more than 280,000 have died, over half of them in Europe, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nIn the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a modest easing of the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s coronavirus lockdown but urged citizens not to surrender the progress already made. The country has recorded the most virus deaths in Europe at over 31,900.\n\nThose in the construction or manufacturing industries or other jobs that can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be done at home \u201a\u00c4\u00fashould be actively encouraged to go to work\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 this week, he said. Johnson, who has taken a tougher line after falling ill himself with what he called \u201a\u00c4\u00fathis devilish illness,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 set a goal of June 1 to begin re-opening schools and shops if the U.K. can control new infections and the transmission rate of each infected person.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe will be driven not by mere hope or economic necessity,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to be driven by the science, the data, and public health.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nGermany, which managed to push new infections below 1,000 daily before deciding to loosen restrictions, has seen regional spikes in cases linked to slaughterhouses and nursing homes. Health officials say the number of people each confirmed virus patient infects rose above 1 again, reflecting a renewed increase in cases. The number must be below 1 for outbreaks to decline.\n\nFrance is letting some younger students go back to school Monday after almost two months out. Attendance won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be compulsory right away. Residents of some Spanish regions will be able to enjoy limited seating at bars, restaurants and other public places Monday, but Madrid and Barcelona, the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s largest cities, will remain shut down.\n\nChina, where the virus was first detected, reported 14 new cases Sunday, its first double-digit rise in 10 days. Eleven of 12 domestic infections were in the northeastern province of Jilin, prompting authorities to raise the threat level in one of its counties, Shulan, to high risk, just days after downgrading all regions to low risk.\n\nAuthorities said the Shulan outbreak originated with a 45-year-old woman who had no recent travel or exposure history but spread it to her husband, three sisters and other relatives. Train services in the county were suspended.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faEpidemic control and prevention is a serious and complicated matter, and local authorities should never be overly optimistic, war-weary or off-guard,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Jilin Communist Party secretary Bayin Chaolu.\n\nSouth Korea reported 34 more cases as new infections linked to nightclubs threaten its hard-won gains against the virus. It was the first time that South Korea\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s daily infections were above 30 in about a month.\n\nJordans reported from Berlin. Associated Press journalists around the world contributed."

According to research by University College London, based on the data collected on 206,128 patients, men were twice as likely to require intensive care, and 60 percent more likely to die after being infected wIth COVID-19.\n\nFacing strong backlash, Ford deleted the tweet, apologizing in a subsequent series of tweets for not \"framing her argument\" clearly and describing her tweet as \"poorly judged\".

Workers and consumers will not return to offices, stores and restaurants if companies cannot be held accountable when they fail to prioritize health and safety. If no one is responsible, no one is safe. People will not go back to their normal routines if they don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t feel safe.\n\nA recent poll found that nearly two-thirds of voters across party lines oppose legislation giving guaranteed immunity to businesses, and even small business owners think it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unnecessary. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce \u201a\u00c4\u00ee which has been demanding legal immunity for decades \u201a\u00c4\u00ee inadvertently revealed in its own polling that \u201a\u00c4\u00faliability protection\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 was the lowest priority of small business owners.\n\nAs the president of an association representing thousands of trial lawyers, I know that there won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be a flood of lawsuits, and the Chamber of Commerce knows this, too.

It will be extremely challenging to prove that a victim was exposed and got sick in one specific place given the number of places or people from which or from whom that victim could have been exposed.\n\nThe cases that move forward will be the ones like those involving nursing homes that kept sick workers on the job resulting in mass death, or food processing plants that offered bonuses to sick employees who came to work.\n\nOUR VIEW:Coronavirus lawsuits immunity requires public health guidelines\n\nNational Consumers League:Immunizing all companies would hurt both workers, consumers\n\nEven then, blanket immunity won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t help those sick workers or the families of those who died \u201a\u00c4\u00ee it will just shield corporations that failed to take reasonable steps.\n\nLet\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s make the health of workers and consumers the top priority and then watch our businesses and economy flourish.

                    "article_content": "Matt O'Brien\n\nAssociated Press\n\nHarnessing today's technology to the task of fighting the coronavirus pandemic is turning out to be more complicated than it first appeared.\n\nThe first U.S. states that rolled out smartphone apps for tracing the contacts of COVID-19 patients are dealing with technical glitches and a general lack of interest by their residents. A second wave of tech-assisted pandemic surveillance tools is on its way, this time with the imprimatur of tech giants Apple and Google. But those face their own issues, among them potential accuracy problems and the fact that they won't share any information with governments that could help track the spread of the illness.\n\nContact tracing is a pillar of infection control. It's traditionally conducted by trained public health workers who interview those who may have been exposed, then urge them to get tested and isolate themselves. Some estimates call for as many as 300,000 U.S. workers to do the work effectively, but so far those efforts have lagged.\n\nApple is reopening some stores this week:Expect to wear a mask, have temperature checked\n\nMore:Apple, Google will warn you if you've been exposed to COVID-19. Here's how.\n\nOther tech companies like Salesforce have offered database tools to assist manual tracing efforts, although those also raise privacy concerns because of the need to collect and store detailed information about people's social connections, health status and whereabouts.\n\nPrivacy concerns over tracking\n\nPrivacy advocates warn that the danger of creating new government surveillance powers for the pandemic could lead to much bigger problems in the future. In a new policy paper shared with The Associated Press, the American Civil Liberties Union is warning state governments to tread more carefully and establish stricter privacy procedures before deploying technology meant to detect and curb new coronavirus outbreaks.\n\nEven the most privacy-minded tools, such as those to be released soon by Apple and Google, require constraints so that they don't become instruments of surveillance or oppression. \"The risks of getting it wrong are enormous,\" said Neema Singh Guliani, a senior legislative counsel with the ACLU.\n\nACLU's report says the worst location-tracking technology should be rejected outright, such as apps that track individual movements via satellite-based GPS technology and feed sensitive personal data into centralized government databases. \"Good designs don't require you to gather people's location information and store that,\" Singh Guliani said.\n\nShe urged governments to set rules addressing both privacy and efficacy so that surveillance tools don't interfere with more conventional public health methods.\n\nUtah, North Dakota and South Dakota were the first U.S. states to launch voluntary phone apps that enable public health departments to track the location and connections of people who test positive for the coronavirus. But governors haven't had much luck getting the widespread participation needed for them to work effectively.\n\nThe state with the highest known rate of participation so far is South Dakota, where last week about 2% of residents had the Care19 app on their phones. Last week was also the first time it recorded a single infection. The same app is getting even less support in North Dakota.\n\n\"This is a red state,\" said Crystal Wolfrum, a paralegal in Minot, North Dakota, who says she's one of the only people among her neighbors and friends to download the app. \"They don't want to wear masks. They don't want to be told what to do. A lot of people I talk to are, like, 'Nope, you're not going to track me.' \"\n\nWolfrum said she's doubtful that the app will be useful, both because of people's wariness and its poor performance. She gave it a bad review on Google's app store after it failed to notice lengthy shopping trips she made one weekend to Walmart and Target stores.\n\nNorth Dakota is now looking at starting a second app based on the Apple-Google technology. \"It was rushed to market,\" because of the urgent need, Vern Dosch, the state's contact tracing facilitator, told KFYR-TV in Bismarck. \"We knew that it wouldn't be perfect.\"\n\nTracking without revealing identity\n\nThe ACLU is taking a more measured approach to the Apple and Google method, which will use Bluetooth wireless technology to automatically notify people about potential COVID-19 exposure without revealing anyone's identity to the government.\n\nBut even if the app is described as voluntary and personal health information never leaves the phone, the ACLU says it's important for governments to set additional safeguards to ensure that businesses and public agencies don't make showing the app a condition of access to jobs, public transit, grocery stores and other services.\n\nAmong the governments experimenting with the Apple-Google approach are the state of Washington and several European countries.\n\nSwiss epidemiologist Marcel Salath\u221a\u00a9 said all COVID-19 apps so far are \"fundamentally broken\" because they collect too much irrelevant information and don't work well with Android and iPhone operating software. Salath\u221a\u00a9 authored a paper favoring the privacy-protecting approach that the tech giants have since adopted, and he considers it the best hope for a tool that could actually help isolate infected people before they show symptoms and spread the disease.\n\n\"You will remember your work colleagues but you will not remember the random person next to you on a train or really close to you at the bar,\" he said.\n\nOther U.S. governors are looking at technology designed to supplement manual contact-tracing efforts. As early as this week, Rhode Island has said it is set to launch a contact-tracing database system mostly built by software giant Salesforce, which has said it is also working with Massachusetts, California, Louisiana and New York City on a similar approach.\n\nSalesforce says it can use data-management software to help trained crews trace \"relationships across people, places and events\" and identify virus clusters down to the level of a neighborhood hardware store. It will rely on manual input of information gathered through conversations by phone, text or email.\n\n\"It's only as good as a lot of us using it,\" Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo said at a news conference last week. \"If 10% of Rhode Island's population opts in, this won't be effective.\" The state hasn't yet outlined what people are expected to opt into.\n\nThe ACLU hasn't yet weighed in on the Salesforce model, but has urged contact-tracing public health departments to protect people from unnecessary disclosure of personal information and to not criminalize the requirement for self-isolation."

                    "article_content": "Illinois\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 peak period of COVID-19 deaths could stretch into early June \u201a\u00c4\u00ec or possibly even July.\n\nAnd that could mean 50 to 150 Illinoisans losing their lives to the coronavirus a day \u201a\u00c4\u00ec or possibly as many as 300 each day.\n\nThose were some of the grim estimates Gov. J.B. Pritzker delivered from his own home on Monday, a mix of troubling projections coupled with a few optimistic signs of progress for parts of the state outside the Chicago area.\n\nThe daily death toll Monday was 54, at the low end of the projections for the peak period. But that follows an especially deadly week, and it was announced amid a new round of scientific modeling.\n\nAnd those dire projections come at an extremely inopportune time for the Democratic governor, who is facing criticism from Republican legislators, unemployed workers who appear stuck in limbo and President Donald Trump.\n\nIt also comes as many in Illinois are suffering from cabin fever, growing increasingly restless over their lives having been disrupted for more than eight weeks.\n\nFor the first time Monday, Pritzker delivered his daily briefing from his home office \u201a\u00c4\u00ee a drawing of his late mother behind him \u201a\u00c4\u00ee as he broadcast live after a senior staffer tested positive for coronavirus. The governor said he himself has tested negative twice for coronavirus.\n\nThe governor also offered some good news along with his bad news projections. After announcing his reopening plan last week that divides the state into four regions and evaluates phases of re-openings based on health metrics, Pritzker said all regions except for the Northeast region \u201a\u00c4\u00faare on pace\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to be able to move to the next phase come May 29, the last day of the stay-at-home executive order.\n\nThe next phase, Phase 3, allows a number of businesses to reopen, with the use of \u201a\u00c4\u00faface coverings as the norm,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 including non-essential manufacturing and some non-essential businesses, including barber shops and salons.\n\nBut in the Northeast region, home to Chicago and Cook County, the positivity rate \u201a\u00c4\u00ee the number of positive cases compared to tests taken \u201a\u00c4\u00ee remains too high. Still, the governor signaled there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s still time to get that number lower. His plan in part entails 14 days of a positivity rate under 20%.\n\nIn total, 3,459 people have died of coronavirus in Illinois \u201a\u00c4\u00ee 803 of them last week. As of Monday, the state also reported 1,266 new cases, bringing the total of positive cases to 79,007. The state received 12,441 tests results.\n\nIn late April, Pritzker\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office released a COVID-19 projection and worst-case fatality scenario based on scientific modeling that predicted a range of 50 to 150 deaths per day into early May. That projection was created by researchers from the Illinois Department of Public Health, as well as researchers from Northwestern University, the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nThe latest projection shows Illinois is indeed in a peak period for coronavirus deaths, but it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s less like a peak and more like a plateau.\n\nThe death range remains between 50 and 150 a day in models from both the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Northwestern University, however, is projecting a range of 50 to 300 daily deaths. The University of Chicago predicts the state seeing a death plateau until July, while both Northwestern and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are predicting it could last until June.\n\nLea este art\u221a\u2260culo en espa\u221a\u00b1ol en La Voz Chicago, un servicio presentado por AARP Chicago.\n\nBeginning on April 23, the state saw 11 days in that originally predicted death range. On May 4, 46 deaths were reported. On May 5, the state saw its worst day with 176 fatalities. And since May 6, the state has consistently seen between 50 and 150 deaths a day, which is what the modelers predicted.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t passed our peak yet. We have seen more stability in our numbers, but so far, we are not seeing significant declines in key metrics like hospitalization,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Pritzker said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe updates to our models reflect that data.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nPritzker said the time frame of \u201a\u00c4\u00faplateauing near a peak\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 into mid-May \u201a\u00c4\u00fahas been expanded from mid-May into mid-June.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIn many ways, this news is disheartening,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Pritzker said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe have made great progress, but it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s forced us to remain at a moderated though still high level of key metrics for this extended period. A pushing out of our estimated peak is a natural consequence of flattening the curve. Remember that no one can truly stop this virus without a vaccine. But what we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been aiming to do since early March is slow down the exponential rate of transmission.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe slowing down, he said, has helped health care workers to treat those with coronavirus and give pharmaceutical researchers time to develop effective treatments and ultimately a vaccine.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faPushing the peak down and therefore to a longer time frame might not sound like good news to some, but I promise you it is saving lives,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Pritzker said.\n\nThe number of COVID-19 patients entering ICU beds went up by 16, from Saturday to Sunday night, according to Pritzker\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s office. The number of ventilators being used by coronavirus patients also increased by 21, and the total number of COVID-19 patients increased by 26 patients.\n\nThe positivity rate statewide as of Monday is 10.17%. In the Northeast region, which includes Cook County and Chicago, the positivity rate is about 22%.\n\nMeanwhile, Pritzker\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s administration said the state has not yet received a shipment of swabs and viral transport media from the federal government. That shipment was anticipated in early May but has not yet arrived. The governor\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s administration is also asking for federal help in obtaining surgical gowns, which are going fast, they said."

                    "article_content": "\n\nThere is a dire need for financial support of healthcare providers and facilities as they continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, now affecting the United States the most drastically. In response, the President signed the bipartisan CARES Act on March 27, 2020, providing much-needed relief funds to hospitals and other healthcare providers on the frontlines of the fight against coronavirus. As part of the recently announced CARES Act, $100 billion will be appropriated to create a Public Health Social Service Emergency Fund with an ultimate goal of preventing, preparing for, and responding to the coronavirus outbreak both domestically and on an international scale.\n\nPer the Act, funding will be dedicated to reimbursing healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 to alleviate some of the financial burden many providers are experiencing. Part of this relief payment will focus on ensuring that uninsured Americans have access to testing and treatment, and that medical professionals providing the care are reimbursed for their work. The Department of Health and Human Services has published detailed criteria for the process of distribution of funds under the Act as well as information about eligibility requirements, outlined below.\n\nImmediate Relief Funding\n\nRecognizing the urgent need for the delivery of financial relief, the HHS immediately infused $30 billion into the American healthcare system. Payments are slated to arrive via direct deposit beginning April 10, 2020 to eligible providers throughout the system. Note, these are direct payments, not loans and will not need to be repaid, the HHS emphasizes.\n\nEligibility for Immediate Relief Payments\n\nPer guidance from the HHS, all facilities and providers that received Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) reimbursements in 2019 are eligible to receive payments from this initial rapid distribution. Payments to practices that are part of larger medical groups will be sent to the group\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s central billing office, while all relief payments will be made to the billing organization according to its Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).\n\nIn order to be eligible to receive these funds, providers must not seek to collect of out-of-pocket payments from a COVID-19 patient that are greater than what they would be otherwise had the care been provided by an in-network practitioner. If a practice had to halt business operations as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, providers may still be eligible to receive funds if they provided diagnoses, testing, or care for patients with possible or confirmed cases of COVID-19. Per the HHS, \u201a\u00c4\u00faCare does not have to be specific to treating COVID-19. HHS broadly views every patient as a possible case of COVID-19.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe immediate relief payments hope to alleviate providers in hard-hit COVID-19 areas and those who are struggling to keep their practice open due to delayed care and widespread cancellations of elective procedures.\n\nPayment Distributions\n\nPayment distributions will be based on the provider\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s or practice\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s share of total Medicare FFS reimbursements for the year 2019; that year, the total FFS payments were approximately $484 billion. Providers can estimate their anticipated payment by dividing their 2019 Medicare FFS (excluding Medicare Advantage) payments \u201a\u00c4\u00ec which can be obtained from their organization\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s revenue management system \u201a\u00c4\u00ec by $484 billion and multiplying that ratio by $30 billion.\n\nReceiving Payments\n\nIn partnership with UnitedHealth Group (UHG), the HHS will provide rapid payments to eligible providers, as described above, to distribute the initial round of funding. Providers will be paid via their Automated Clearing House account information on file with UHG or the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and can expect to receive payments via Optum Bank with \u201a\u00c4\u00faHHSPAYMENT\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 as the payment description. Providers who receive reimbursements from CMS via paper check can expect to receive a paper check in the mail within the next few weeks.\n\nProviders must sign an attestation confirming receipt of the funds and agreeing to the terms and conditions of payment within 30 days of receipt. The Terms and Conditions of the funding can be found on the CMS website. If the payment is not returned within 30 days, the HHS will view this as an acceptance of the Terms and Conditions. However, if a provider does not wish to comply with the Terms and Conditions, they must contact HHS within 30 days of receipt of payment and then return the full payment to HHS.\n\nDifferent Types of Providers\n\nAll relief payments are being made to providers according to their tax identification number (TIN). Large organizations will receive payments for each of their billing TINs that bill Medicare, and should look to the part of their organization that handles Medicare billing to identify details on Medicare payments for 2019. Employed physicians should not expect to receive an individual payment directly; instead, their employer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s organization will receive the relief payment as the billing organization. Similarly, individual physicians and providers in a group practice are unlikely to receive individual payments directly; the group practice will receive the relief fund payment as the billing organization. Solo practitioners who bill Medicare will receive a payment under the TIN they use to bill Medicare.\n\nThe Remaining $70 Billion\n\nAs part of the $100 billion guaranteed by the CARES Act, the remaining $70 billion will be comprised of targeted distributions focused on providers in areas particularly impacted by the virus, rural providers, providers of services with lower shares of Medicare reimbursement or who predominantly serve the Medicaid population, as well as providers requesting reimbursement for the treatment of uninsured Americans. More guidance is expected on the structure of these payments in the coming weeks.\n\nCOVID-19 Medical Expenses\n\nThe federal government is taking measures to ensure Americans are not surprised by medical expenses and are protected against financial obstacles that might prevent them from seeking care or getting tested and treated for COVID-19. A portion of the Provider Relief Fund will be used to reimburse healthcare providers at Medicare rates for COVID-related treatment of the uninsured. However, providers are prohibited from \u201a\u00c4\u00fabalance billing\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 any patient for COVID-related treatment in order to be eligible.\n\nIn addition, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act requires private insurers to cover an insurance plan member\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s cost-sharing payments for COVID-19 testing. Further, the government has secured commitments from private insurers \u201a\u00c4\u00ec such as Humana, Cigna, UnitedHealthGroup, and the Blue Cross Blue Shield system \u201a\u00c4\u00ec to waive cost-sharing payments for treatment related to COVID-19 for its members and make medical care more accessible.\n\nHeavily anticipated by providers across the nation, the latest guidance helps to clarify eligibility, distribution, and payment concerns regarding the Provider Relief Fund. Eligible practices and providers may soon expect to receive payments from the immediate round of funding. In the meantime, medical professionals can access more information about and the latest developments concerning the CARES Act Provider Relief Fund here."

                    "article_content": "Today, as America faces a difficult debate about \u201a\u00c4\u00fareopening\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 state economies during the coronavirus pandemic, The New York Times seemingly offered a helpful piece of guidance. The paper\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s opinion section published a visualization of how people engage with different businesses like bars and gyms, estimating their risk of infection at each. Alarmingly, it dubbed some of these places dangerous \u201a\u00c4\u00fasuper-spreader businesses\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ee warning that \u201a\u00c4\u00fathrough the lens of contagion, a yoga class, a busy corner store, or a crowded neighborhood bar may look a lot like a wet market in China.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBut at least in this story, the real worry isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t contagion. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s the sweeping assumptions being trained on some very limited data. And it doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t say much about whether your local bar can avoid serving coronavirus with its Coronas. That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s because the story doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t include any infection data.\n\nLocation data can track patterns, but not whether they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re still relevant\n\nThe Times story is written by four professors at the University of Chicago, who aggregated anonymized phone location data from April of 2019. Using that data, they plotted how people flowed through locations that corresponded to businesses \u201a\u00c4\u00ee learning which kinds of stores saw customers linger the longest, which drew the biggest crowds, and which squeezed the most people into the smallest spaces. They bolstered that data with surveys asking how much participants interacted with other people or touched shared surfaces in these places.\n\nThe new coronavirus is spreading through the US, and several states have made emergency declarations. The World Health Organization has declared it a pandemic. Here are the basics: Everything you need to know about the coronavirus\n\nThe tracking project produced some interesting factoids. Denny\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s and the Original Pancake House served similar numbers of people for similar amounts of time, but the latter saw a breakfast rush that produced more crowding. People stayed twice as long at electronics stores as lawn and garden stores \u201a\u00c4\u00ee the authors speculate that \u201a\u00c4\u00fayou don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t linger over fertilizer.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBut data from a year ago might tell us very little about the present or future. Many of these businesses have either been closed for weeks or drastically altered their operations. They\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll probably reopen (if they reopen at all) under restrictions that render a lot of these observations moot, like spacing rules that will stop those large brunch crowds or arrangements that decrease close-range interactions and shared surfaces.\n\nEven assuming GPS records perfectly track who\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s inside or outside a building \u201a\u00c4\u00ee not a given \u201a\u00c4\u00ee we don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know if they reflect how post-pandemic consumers will behave. People might maintain those old browsing styles, but they might also consciously avoid lingering anywhere, or the coronavirus might produce unpredictable new patterns. (For all we know, if everybody\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s planting a COVID-19 victory garden, maybe they will linger over fertilizer.) People\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s safety doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t hinge on how they behaved in stores and restaurants a year ago, but about how well a given business can adapt to promote new habits and minimize their risk.\n\nWithout infection data, naming \u201a\u00c4\u00f2super-spreading\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 businesses is a huge stretch\n\nThe authors acknowledge that limitations exist, and they note that \u201a\u00c4\u00fathese data alone cannot tell us which businesses to open first, and we can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t simplify all these different metrics into a \u201a\u00c4\u00f2yes\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 or \u201a\u00c4\u00f2no\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 decision on any single business.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 But this uncertainty doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t make it into the overall framing of the story, particularly the claim that certain businesses are \u201a\u00c4\u00fasuper-spreaders\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ee which is not just an oversimplification, but an absurd rhetorical stretch.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faSuper-spreader\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 is normally reserved for a person or place that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s linked to dozens or hundreds of COVID-19 cases, including a funeral in Georgia, a party in Connecticut, and numerous meatpacking plants, nursing homes, and prisons. The Times editorial co-opts it for businesses that might be risky compared to other stores and restaurants. And it does this without using hard data to establish how much each of its risk factors practically matters, not just whether they hypothetically make infection more likely. We have no idea how good the assumptions of this model are.\n\nIn fact, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s extrapolating danger based on a painfully incomplete knowledge of the coronavirus. Epidemiologists know the mechanics of how the virus can spread, but they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not sure what\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s specifically driving many infections and how they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re affected by a multitude of environmental factors. Countries\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 rapidly-expanding contact tracing programs can help solve that mystery by finding links between cases. But beyond facts like extreme crowding and poor ventilation being dangerous, there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not a precise risk assessment right now for different densities and exposure times.\n\nThere are huge gaps in our understanding of coronavirus\n\nIt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s normal for research and reporting to include simplifications or caveats. And mis-evaluating Red Lobster\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s pandemic fitness is less pernicious than, say, promoting drugs that probably don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t work. But it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s bad to pitch simple conclusions (like \u201a\u00c4\u00fabookstores are high-risk\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 or \u201a\u00c4\u00faflorists are safe,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to name two of the model\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s assertions) as policy recommendations when they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re backed up by so little evidence and so much speculation, especially when people are grasping for advice about a deadly and often baffling disease.\n\nWarnings \u201a\u00c4\u00ee or reassurances \u201a\u00c4\u00ee about coronavirus can become conventional wisdom even if they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re mostly speculative. One pre-print research paper with flashy graphics, for instance, seemed to show joggers and cyclists barreling down streets in a vast miasmatic breath cloud. The paper was an aerodynamic simulation that didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t establish whether the air could actually infect bystanders. But it was still widely shared with warnings against exercising outside. And even that paper didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t go as far as calling runners \u201a\u00c4\u00fasuper-spreaders\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ee which, as Guardian reporter Julia Carrie Wong noted on Twitter, is an incredibly loaded term for businesses that aren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t accused of spreading anything.\n\nAmid a lot of bad-faith attacks on media during the pandemic\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s first several weeks, there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a fair critique that news outlets have promoted research and recommendations far too authoritatively, instead of reflecting the incredible confusion among experts. Meanwhile, Silicon Valley critics have cautioned against overemphasizing high-tech solutions to the disease \u201a\u00c4\u00ee including the Times itself, which warned that putting too much stock in tracking data might simply \u201a\u00c4\u00faprovide an opening for technologists to oversell what they do.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nOverselling is exactly the problem here. This kind of location data could provide some limited guidance for businesses. But if, as the Times\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s headline puts it, you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re curious if it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s safer to visit a coffee shop or a gym? These clean charts don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t hold the answer."

In addition, American contractors sell Israel some of the most classified military hardware and weapons in the US like the F-35 fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, according to the Israeli daily.\n\nThe US is concerned that with China building most of Israel\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s infrastructure \u201a\u00c4\u00ec roads, trains, tunnels, ports and more \u201a\u00c4\u00ec it will eventually gain access to the lines of communication through which Israel and the US communicate intelligence with one another. That is something that Washington will not tolerate, said the report.\n\nFor too long, Israel has cozied up to China while ignoring potential ramifications or fallout with its greatest ally, the United States, the newspaper said.\n\nHowever, Tel Aviv could be on a collision course with Washington unless tight restrictions are imposed on Chinese investment in Israel, because the US president sees this both as a geopolitical security threat and a distraction from accomplishing the objectives of his trade war with China.\n\nAccording to Israel's Army Radio on Tuesday, Tel Aviv has asked Washington for compensation in exchange for reducing ties with China - an offer that the US reportedly rejected.\n\nThe ongoing friction between the US and China has escalated in recent months in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, and the US has put pressure on many of its allies as a result.\n\nThe US has accused China of hiding news of the original outbreak of the novel coronavirus from the world.\n\nPresident Trump has long called COVID-19 a \u201a\u00c4\u00faChinese virus,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 going so far as to accuse Chinese President Xi Jinping of standing behind a \u201a\u00c4\u00fadisinformation and propaganda attack on the United States and Europe.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe current venomous rhetoric by Trump and his allies about China\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faculpability\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 for the COVID-19 pandemic has led to strong reactions from Chinese officials.\n\nChina's Ambassador to Israel Du Wei, who was found dead in his official residence in Herzliya last Sunday, had made a high-profile defense of his country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn an interview with Israel's Makor Rishon newspaper in April, Du addressed the matter of Chinese investments in Israel, expressing hope for further cooperation.\n\nHe also expressed hope to strengthen the ties between Israel and China, addressing the accusations leveled at his country as being the one responsible for the outbreak of the virus.\n\nMystery and speculation surrounds the death and comments from readers under an online article in the Jerusalem Post included: \u201a\u00c4\u00faSomething smells fishy here.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nAnother said there was \u201a\u00c4\u00faa long list of suspects,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and the envoy\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s death was like something in a spy movie, or the US murder investigation show CSI (Crime Scene Investigation).\n\nOthers suggested a link to Pompeo\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s recent whirlwind visit to Israel, during which he was overtly critical of China, and demanded that Israel stop sharing confidential military information with Beijing."

                    "article_content": "COVID-19\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s hidden victims, Alzheimer's patients in nursing homes Nearly 50% of all nursing home residents live with Alzheimer's or dementia.\n\nWhen Ken Gregersen, 88, left his wife's nursing home in Ankeny, Iowa, on March 11, he didn't know that that would be the last time he'd see her for two months.\n\n\"I got an email, or I got notified by the care facility that no longer could I visit her. So I haven't actually seen her then since March,\" he told ABC News.\n\nEvie, his wife of 67 years, is in the late stages of Alzheimer's disease and receives hospice care. Just like thousands across the country, her nursing home closed its doors to visitors amid the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nHoward Smith visits his wife, Lois, a 77-year-old Alzheimer's patient, at the New Paltz Center nursing facility for the first time since lockdowns due to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Pine Bush, NY., May 5, 2020. Caitlin Ochs/Reuters\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has rocked long-term care facilities. State data analyzed by ABC News reveals that almost a third of coronavirus deaths come from nursing homes.\n\nWith nearly half of all long-term care facility residents living with Alzheimer's or dementia, individuals with the disease have become one of the most disproportionately impacted groups from COVID-19 in the country.\n\nAs coronavirus-related deaths continue to climb, some observers have raised alarms that not enough is being done to protect Alzheimer's and dementia patients and those in long-term care facilities.\n\n\"Given some of the numbers that have now emerged, it's pretty clear that we did not have and probably still today don't have what would be full transparency on an accurate and timely basis about where the cases are occurring,\" Alzheimer's Association CEO Harry Johns told ABC News.\n\nAlzheimer's, a chronic neurodegenerative disease, itself, does not make someone more vulnerable to coronavirus. However, those with the illness are more susceptible because they are usually older and/or have co-morbidities. Living in nursing homes also heightens the COVID-19 exposure risk for Alzheimer's and dementia patients.\n\nStill, health concerns are not the only extra burden these individuals carry amid the outbreak. The enforced separation of nursing home residents from their families and loved ones may only increase the hardship.\n\nIn this June 4, 2017, file photo, President and CEO of Alzheimer's Association, Harry Johns, attends the Nashville Disco Party Benefiting Alzheimer's Association in Nashville. Rick Diamond/Getty Images for Alzheimer's Association, FILE\n\n\"Depending on the degree of progression of the disease, someone with Alzheimer's may not understand what's going on,\" Johns said.\n\n\"[They] may not understand then why they can't leave the house. Why the kids are at home and extended family. Those kinds of confusions can, in and of themselves create challenges for the individual who has dementia, as well as for those carers,\" he added.\n\nJohns says he believes current public health circumstances impact those with Alzheimer's more than other care home residents.\n\n\"For any resident that family contact is so important if someone is ill. But for Alzheimer's, people who have dementia, it is especially difficult because the connections to family can -- when someone has progressed -- keep them grounded,\" Johns told ABC News.\n\nCoronavirus has also forced families of individuals living with Alzheimer's and dementia to navigate not seeing their loved ones for extended periods of time.\n\n\"It's not enjoyable at all. I don't know the right emotional words to say. I really do miss her. We're a very close couple, we've been married this long. We've had a wonderful marriage,\" Ken Gregersen said.\n\nKen and Evie Gregersen of Ankeny, Iowa have been married for 67 years. Courtesy of Ken Gregersen\n\nKen's wife, Evie, moved to her nursing home in 2016 after her Alzheimer's diagnosis in 2012. Before the coronavirus outbreak, he would visit his wife three times a day.\n\n\"I would go over there and give her her breakfast. And then I'd go back and give her her lunch, and then I also (went) back to give her her dinner in the evening. And that's when I usually stayed a few minutes extra and I'd walk her around in her wheelchair and sing a song to her. And so I could then go from being her caregiver to being her husband again,\" he said.\n\nWhile Evie's nursing home ended visits, Ken still talks to his wife every weekday on FaceTime. He said as Evie's condition deteriorates -- she can no longer open her eyes or speak -- he worries about many unknowns.\n\nEvie Gregersen was first diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2012. She moved to a nursing home in 2016. Ken Olson Photography\n\n\"Every day, when I see her FaceTime, and I talk to her and I try to tell her, what's going on in my life, or what are our children or grandchildren are doing, I always wonder does she hear me? Does she understand me? Does she miss me? You know, it makes me very anxious,\" he added.\n\nAlthough Evie's nursing home has reported no patients or caregivers testing positive for coronavirus, Ken still worries what could happen if his wife contracts the virus.\n\n\"I know that I'm going to lose her someday. I mean I'm prepared for that. I think people who are taking care of someone with Alzheimer's, they start through the grieving process long before death occurs,\" he said.\n\n\"I know it's going to occur, but I don't want her to suffer. And the COVID virus ... it looks like there's a lot of suffering going on, you know, gasping for air and being so uncomfortable. That worries me,\" he added.\n\nBefore the coronavirus outbreak, Ken Gregersen would visit his wife three times a day at her nursing home. Courtesy of Ken Gregersen\n\nKen says he's satisfied with the precautions Evie's nursing home has taken. However, as coronavirus cases rise in long-term care facilities, there have been calls for states and the federal government to do more to protect care facilities.\n\nThis week, the Alzheimer's Association announced new policy recommendations to fight coronavirus in long-term care facilities.\n\nJohns identifies increased transparency, testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) as critical in fighting the disease at nursing homes, and helping to get to a point where family members can visit their loved ones.\n\n\"We believe it takes these multiple approaches. That PPE will make a difference, but if you don't have the testing, then you can't prevent the outbreaks. If you don't have the transparency, you can't deal rapidly enough with the outbreaks. So, it is the dynamic combination of doing these things that we believe is most crucial,\" Johns said.\n\n\"It is the dynamic of all of these things happening to improve people's lives, save people's lives and really, relieve the burden that is so present for people who care for those with Alzheimer's and other dementia,\" he added.\n\nOn Monday, President Donald Trump's administration also called for increased coronavirus testing with Vice President Mike Pence telling governors he wants to see every state prioritize COVID-19 screening inside the facilities.\n\nHowever, those guidelines do not go as far as those of the Alzheimer's Association.\n\nBut until those guidelines are met, people continue to wait to visit their loved ones living in long-term care facilities. Meanwhile, family members, like Gregersen, settle for seeing their parents, spouses and friends' faces confined to portable screens.\n\n\"Thank goodness the hospice caregivers who come in set up a FaceTime event Monday to Friday so that I get a chance to see [Evie's] face. She no longer opens her eyes, but I'd like to think that she hears my voice. And I'd like to think she recognizes it,\" Gregerson said.\n\nWhat to know about coronavirus:\n\nHow it started and how to protect yourself: Coronavirus explained\n\nWhat to do if you have symptoms: Coronavirus symptoms\n\nTracking the spread in the U.S. and worldwide: Coronavirus map"

                    "article_content": "Article courtesy of: Carol Petersen, RPh, CNP\n\nViruses have been with us since the dawn of man. An estimated 380 trillion viruses can infect the human body at any one time. (1) Human biology is exquisitely tuned to defeat viruses or to coexist with viruses as part of the human viome. Our relationship with microbes is vibrant and sometimes a fight for one-upmanship. (2) Our existence is a testament to our ability to manage viral loads.\n\nThe pharmacopeias of the world, of some 500,000 different drugs, contain long lists of substances which have antiviral, antibiotic and immune boosting substances. This list alone of antiviral drugs (3) is impressive. It is almost certain that within the realm of the worldwide knowledge of substances, that some would exist which would counter the threat of the coronavirus and any other virus that overwhelms us.\n\nGiven the threat of global viral pandemics, how can the whole of the world\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s medical and scientific communities not be mobilized and galvanized? Is it beyond the world\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s governments to open the door of their various warehouses to find an antidote to the coronavirus which is now strongly suspected to have been developed as a bioweapon? If this is the case, it is almost a certainty that there are multiple antiviral agents already at hand to control this plague.\n\nBut, for a moment, let\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s assume the opposite. That this coronavirus is a previously unseen natural biological agent created by Mother Nature on her worst day. The sum of the world\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s scientific and academic brain power should still have the means to undo this clever virus.\n\nA virus is a little thing with very few operating parts and no immune system of its own and no ability to reproduce on its own. The entire animal world including humans cannot have existed thus far without the knowledge and the means to overcome not only the coronavirus, but all virus pathogens whether bioengineered or not, collectively, can and do the governments of the world deliberately keep information from us? Some reporters are noting that the top virologists and microbiologists in the world are mysteriously dying or disappearing, to the toll of over 100 and counting. (4)(5) Why?\n\nThese are urgent times. The reality is that we have the ability, mindpower, and manpower. What we don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have is the approbation of the powers that be. Doctors are not allowed to be doctors. Scientists are handcuffed into belief systems that must have authority approval. The coronavirus pandemic has been projected to kill as many as 65 million people (6). If projections hold true, this is a time that requires great courage to step out and tap into our incredible human resources. Some world leaders have called for a population reduction by at least 15% and some as high as 90%. (7)\n\nThose who have become physicians must step up and act as the healers and leaders that they intended to be. We are now in a situation that demands a higher calling. Step up and do what you know to be right for yourself and humanity, there may not be a next chance if you do not.\n\nFollowing is a short list of available therapies which can have a positive impact on quelling a pandemic. Some therapies should be used right away to make sure that your immune system is in order. Some should be used at the first sign of illness for speedy recovery. Finally, some will be offered for cytokine storms. The immune system overreacts to the infection, and the resulting inflammation overwhelms the body. Cytokine storms can lead to sepsis (infection carried in the blood stream leading to organ collapse) which is often fatal. However, there have been successful interventions for sepsis and the preceding pneumonia.\n\nThere are well documented and proven interventions that have been reported in clinical literature again and again over the past 100 years - you must not ignore the solutions on hand while waiting for officially approved new proprietary drugs while people are dying.\n\nIonic Solutions and Colloids of Silver and Copper\n\nBefore antibiotics, silver was the antibiotic of choice. Silver solutions can be prepared to drink on a regular basis as preventative or used to treat. Silver solutions can be used in neti pots for the nose or simply used as a nasal spray. In extreme cases, silver has been used as an intravenous treatment. (8). Copper solutions can be used to disinfect surfaces.(9)\n\nOzone\n\nOzone is a gas which quickly converts into oxygen which can treat any infection. It can be added to water to drink, used to clean produce and surfaces. It can be used in therapy in the ears, vaginally and rectally. It is too irritating to the lungs to inhale unless bubbled through an oil first. Ozonated oils can be used on the skin. The American Association of Ozone Therapy (AOT) website provides information and a physician referral. A trained practitioner is needed for ozone to be used intravenously. (10) Dr. Robert Rowen teaches ozone therapies to train practitioners. He traveled to Sri Lanka to treat Ebola with ozone injected directly. (11) Before being impeded by an authoritative government, he was able to demonstrate recovery from Ebola with ozone. He pioneered doing an intravenous therapy using 10 passes of ozone. This can be used for the most resistant of infections.\n\nOxygen/Hyperbaric Oxygen/Hydrogen peroxide\n\nOxygen can be delivered in other forms to deal with infections. At the first sign of respiratory distress in hospitals, patients are given oxygen to breathe. Home units of oxygen concentrators can be used to improve oxygenation. Hyperbaric chambers supply extra oxygen to the whole body at pressure. Tissue oxygenation happens while bypassing the lungs. When hydrogen peroxide bubbles, water and oxygen are released yielding its disinfectant qualities. Hydrogen peroxide can clean surfaces, and it can be used in the ears and gargled diluted in water at the first sign of a cold or flu. Hydrogen peroxide is also used medically intravenously and provides increased oxygen levels for the body.\n\nHydrochloric Acid, Hydrogen\n\nThere is a book documenting the incredible effects of hydrochloric acid (HCl). \u201a\u00c4\u00faThree Years of Hydrochloric Acid Therapy\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 which can be viewed by clicking here. Hydrochloric acid is used both intramuscularly and intravenously and provides an immune system boost. Molecular hydrogen ions or hydrogen gas can be used therapeutically to quell oxidative stress. The science behind hydrogen is compiled at the Molecular Hydrogen Institute. (12)\n\nIntravenous and Oral Vitamin C\n\nVitamin C is available to use orally and has been ever since Dr. Linus Pauling demonstrated its antiviral effects. To use orally, instructions are to use vitamin C in frequent dosing to the point of getting diarrhea and then backing down but not stopping and continuing till resolved. Vitamin C can be taken daily for maintenance. Dr. Pauling himself used about 30 gm of vitamin C daily. (13) 60 Minutes aired a segment on the miraculous recovery of a New Zealand man who was given intravenous vitamin C and recovered quickly from a viral infection after doctors had recommended that the family stop all life support, and death would ensue in 1-2 days. Normally, you would think that this would shake the medical communities of the world to action to provide intravenous vitamin C for all critical infections. Intravenous vitamin C is a mainstay in functional medicine but is not to be found in our hospitals. Search out providers ahead of time in case this modality is needed.(14) Dr. Fred Klenner used both intramuscular vitamin C and intravenous vitamin C for numerous viral infections including polio successfully. However, his groundbreaking work was ignored in favor of the promotion of a vaccine program. (15)\n\nUltraviolet Blood Irradiation or Photo Luminescence\n\nExposing the blood to the ultraviolet spectrum of light was developed in the 1920\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s and also suffered a fate like Dr. Fred Klenner\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s treatments for virus infections. This time it was the advent of penicillin that became the favored treatment. In this approach only a small amount of blood is removed and exposed to light in the ultraviolet range, then the blood is returned to the body. Then there is a profound increase in oxygen, and blood immune components are improved dramatically. This treatment can be used to quell the dangerous cytokine storms and rescue patients from sepsis. The equipment and supplies are very inexpensive and treatment time is just minutes. There are practitioners who still use this therapy in their practices.(16) (17)\n\nThis article highlights some of the opportunities that can and should be implemented in managing a pandemic. Effective treatments have already been developed and abandoned, sometimes for less effective treatments. Some of these are do it yourself solutions, and most need the intervention of a skilled practitioner. Be prepared by learning where and how these therapies can be readily accessed. There is much more in that warehouse of human ingenuity. Remember the most vulnerable are the young, old, and those with existing conditions. This discussion will be continued."

That brings the statewide total to 22,025 cases and 794 deaths.\n\nJim Allen, spokesman for the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners, said the board is sending letters to all voters and other election workers who may have come in contact with Burke at the polling place to inform them they may have been exposed.\n\nAllen said it is the fourth letter sent from the board in the aftermath of the election warning of specific instances of possible COVID exposure because of a known confirmed case of someone who either worked or voted at a polling place.\n\nThe other letters involved the following polling places: Andrew Jackson Language Academy, 1340 W. Harrison, in the 28th Ward; Montclare Senior Residences, 1200 E. 78th St. in the 8th Ward; and William Dever School, 3436 N. Osceola, which hosted precincts from both the 29th and 38th Wards.\n\nMatt Dietrich, a spokesman for the State Board of Elections, said this is the first report in Illinois of an election worker dying from the coronavirus.\n\nAccording to the Cook County Medical Examiner\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s report of COVID-19 victims, Burke suffered from diabetes and hypertensive arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease.\n\nAld. David Moore (17th) said Burke\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s family had asked him to not discuss his death.\n\nPreviously, the alderman posted photos of Burke on his Facebook page and described him as a \u201a\u00c4\u00facommitted\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 17th Ward precinct captain and 15-year city employee.\n\nThe alderman noted Burke wrote on his own Facebook introduction: \u201a\u00c4\u00faLife is too short stay Happy. I love being with family and friends. Bowling, shooting pool, road trip.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9"

                    "article_content": "Not every child is born with skills to solve math equations and divide and multiply swiftly. Most of them struggle with calculations, algebra, and graphs. And the approach most parents take in pushing them toward the ability is through destructive and degrading feedback. Yes, math is an essential part of the world, and without this basic skill, no person can succeed in life. But there are better ways of infusing this mindset in children than by force.\n\nAdministering the latest situation of complete or partial lockdown in all coronavirus infected countries, with no sign of educational institutes reopening, you as a parent may be more than ever worried about the math education of your children. Teachers and school administrations are doing their best with video lectures, but the engagement and productive factors are lessened.\n\nIn a time like this, the best thing you can do is take it upon yourself to give your child the math education they truly need. This can be done by showing them real-life examples of math problems. Most kids aren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t good at math because they don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t understand how it works and aren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t able to apply it in everyday life.\n\nIn addition to including real-life problems, you can make use of the internet by downloading highly interactive math puzzles, math educating games and apps, fun math videos, and more. Take out the board games that have been eating dust in your attic to play with your kids, as several of them are related to math problem-solving. Or make games by yourself using cutout numbers and math symbols for kids to learn and have fun."

                    "article_content": "You'll only get the best stuff we have!\n\nGet the best Trump news straight to your inbox!\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci appeared for interviews Friday and dropped a grenade into the nation\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s reopening conversation.\n\nStay-at-home orders intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus could end up causing \u201a\u00c4\u00fairreparable damage\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 if imposed for too long, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNBC on Friday. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want people to think that any of us feel that staying locked down for a prolonged period of time is the way to go,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Fauci said during an interview with CNBC\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Meg Tirrell on \u201a\u00c4\u00faHalftime Report.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nIndeed. The country has only been discussing this very topic for weeks now, as between 38.6 and 43 million Americans have been thrown into unemployment thanks directly to the coronavirus shutdown.\n\nThe discussion has not included Dr. Fauci, and he appears to have been sidelined from making public comments by the White House in recent days. During those same days, President Trump has increasingly called for states to lift restrictions and let the reopening begin.\n\nDuring the same interview, Dr. Fauci poured some cold water on reopenings that are underway, but in that passive-aggressive way of doing so without being specific.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIn general, I think most of the country is doing it in a prudent way,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThere are obviously some situations where people might be jumping over that. I just say please proceed with caution if you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re going to do that.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nNot helpful. Who is jumping ahead? Florida \u201a\u00c4\u00ee which has not seen a spike despite dire media predictions that it would? Texas \u201a\u00c4\u00ee which is crab-walking toward reopening while about 46% of its coronavirus deaths statewide have been in nursing homes? Or is California taking entirely too long? How about Michigan and the whimsical Gov. Whitmer?\n\nPeople need to work. The economy crashes and a whole lot more people will die the longer the shutdowns drag on.\n\nWhile some in the capital cocktail set see Dr. Fauci as a sex symbol, he has been a panic peddler during much of this crisis.\n\nFor instance, May 13, 2020: As states reopened, Dr. Fauci warned of \u201a\u00c4\u00faneedless suffering and death\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 if states move too fast.\n\nUnemployment was already well over 20 million by then, or roughly the whole population of the state of New York. A million of those newly unemployed are healthcare workers. Hospitals and medical practices have been creaking and threatening to collapse since early April.\n\nSince then, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve blown past that unemployment number, past Florida, past Texas, to leave the equivalent of the entire population of California unemployed.\n\nPlus or minus a million or two.\n\nHow, in what universe, can unemployment on this scale not cause \u201a\u00c4\u00fairreparable damage?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nEspecially when an estimated 42% of these unemployed and their jobs are never ever ever getting back together?\n\nOur energy sector went from powering everything to being vulnerable to foreign takeover in a flash.\n\nWhole national job-creating companies have filed for bankruptcy or laid thousands of their workers off.\n\nAnd the federal government is writing hot checks in the trillions every few weeks.\n\nThis is by definition \u201a\u00c4\u00fairreparable damage,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Dr. F.\n\nI haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t been too critical of Fauci up to this point. He\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s an epidemiologist trying to prevent mass death from a virus. His job is not to worry about the economics.\n\nBut it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s looking increasingly like we need a second opinion, from another doctor who also has run a practice and therefore understands economics. As Sen. Rand Paul, who is a doctor, noted in Senate testimony in mid-May, Dr. Fauci isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t the \u201a\u00c4\u00fabe all end all\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of this crisis. Dr. Fauci actually agreed. And he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not.\n\nThe economic dimension of this crisis has long stayed in the back seat while the healthcare dimension took the wheel. That was reasonable in the beginning. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a pandemic, which is a medical crisis first and foremost.\n\nThey both need some time in the driver\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s seat. We\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve flattened the curve. There\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s no evidence at this point (it could change!) that reopening is causing serious spikes in new infections. We still haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t come to grips with the facts on nursing home and assisted living facitlity-related coronavirus deaths nationwide. That discussion has not happened in any serious way.\n\nNeither has the necessary discussion about suicides related to economic misery.\n\nWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re past time for all that.\n\nVia PJMedia"

The country, an epicenter of the pandemic, plans to be mostly reopened within the next few weeks, with strict health guidelines.\n\nThe Italian government plans to allow travel to and from the country beginning June 3, according to a new decree signed Saturday by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. Citizens will also be able to travel freely within the country starting that same day.\n\nCertain travel may still be limited based on disease risks, which will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. People who have tested positive for COVID-19 will still remain under strict quarantine orders.\n\nThe travel ban lifts the day after Italy's Republic Day, likely preventing mass travel over a long holiday weekend.\n\nItaly's infection rate has fallen sharply in recent days. Despite calls for a quicker reopening, Conte said a gradual return to normalcy can help prevent a second wave of infections, Reuters reports.\n\nSome shops in Italy start to reopen amid pandemic\n\nAccording to the decree, all sectors of the economy still shuttered can reopen in June, as long as proper safety guidelines, social distancing and hygiene rules are adhered to. Health officials plan to closely monitor reopening in order to limit further infections.\n\nThe country maintained strict lockdown guidelines until May 4, when it allowed factories and parks to reopen. Shops plan to open May 18, and that same day, people will be able to move freely within their region.\n\nBefore coronavirus truly took hold in the United States, Italy had the highest number of COVID-19 infections in the world. It was the first European country to impose nationwide lockdown restrictions and has struggled for months to limit the virus' spread.\n\nItaly currently has the fifth-highest number of confirmed infections globally with over 233,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases.

                    "article_content": "The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits in the two months since the coronavirus took hold in the U.S. has swelled to nearly 39 million, the government reported Thursday, even as states from coast to coast gradually reopen their economies and let people go back to work.\n\nMore than 2.4 million people filed for unemployment last week in the latest wave of layoffs from the business shutdowns that have brought the economy to its knees, the Labor Department said.\n\nThat brings the running total to a staggering 38.6 million, a job-market collapse unprecedented in its speed.\n\nThe number of weekly applications has slowed for seven straight weeks. Yet the figures remain breathtakingly high \u201a\u00c4\u00ee 10 times higher than normal before the crisis struck.\n\nIt shows that even though all states have begun reopening over the past three weeks, employment has yet to snap back and the outbreak is still damaging businesses and destroying jobs.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWhile the steady decline in claims is good news, the labor market is still in terrible shape,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said over the weekend that U.S. unemployment could peak in May or June at 20% to 25%, a level last seen during the depths of the Great Depression almost 90 years ago. Unemployment in April stood at 14.7%, a figure also unmatched since the 1930s.\n\nOver 5 million people worldwide have been confirmed infected by the virus, and about 330,000 deaths have been recorded, including about 94,000 in the U.S. and around 165,000 in Europe, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University and based on government data. Experts believe the true toll is significantly higher. \u201a\u00c4\u00ec READ MORE\n\nListen to the insightful Thomas Paine Podcast Below --"

                    "article_title": "CBS: Fairgrounds Around U.S. Being Converted Into Detention Centers, One Arrested for Trying to Escape",
                    "article_content": "Cities around the country are converting their fairgrounds into make-shift quarantine/detention centers to house coronavirus patients who are homeless.\n\nOne such city is Nashville, Tennessee, where the fairgrounds are being used by the city in an attempt to quash an outbreak among homeless residents. Dr. Alex Jahangir, chairman of the city\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s coronavirus task force, said everyone who has tested positive can be ordered into quarantine. He added:\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faEveryone is entitled to come and go as they want, typically, but in the fairgrounds situation we wanted to make sure that people who are positive stayed in the ill parts of the shelter \u201a\u00c4\u00ee period.\u201a\u00c4\u00f91\n\nJahangir said the vast majority of people who tested positive in Nashville have cooperated with officials, so \u201a\u00c4\u00faformal quarantines\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 have been unnecessary. However, the city has the option of using a legally enforceable quarantine order whenever necessary, and recently had to do so after a COVID-19 patient jumped a fence and fled the Nashville Fairgrounds.\n\nHealth officials informed the man he could not leave until he was cleared, but he jumped a fence and left anyway, according to the arrest affidavit, which was the first of its kind in the city. The man was stopped and arrested by Metro Nashville Parks police by a city cemetery nearly two miles from where he had been quarantined.\n\nThe arrest highlights the difference between citizens advised to remain at home and those ordered into quarantine. The mayor of Nashville has instructed residents to stay home as much as possible. However, those who test positive for coronavirus can be ordered into quarantine, which police can enforce.\n\nRELATED STORY:\n\nIn addition to Nashville, commissioners in Palm Beach County, Florida unanimously approved a plan to shelter the homeless in the old Palm Beach County Detention Center near the South Florida Fairgrounds.\n\nResidents in the area sounded off, expressing frustration at being left out of the conversation. One such resident, Blair English, said:\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are worried about having up to 125 homeless people right down the road from us.\u201a\u00c4\u00f92\n\nRELATED STORY:\n\nCounty leaders say the old detention center is a safe place for the homeless to lay their heads. They\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll have access to job training and medical care. Palm Beach County Mayor Dave Kerner added:\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faWhen folks come to the county commission and say \u201a\u00c4\u00f2I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want this person in my backyard,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 well they are not going to be in your backyard. But they are in other people\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s backyard right now and they are not being well taken care of by the government and that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not acceptable.\u201a\u00c4\u00f92\n\nPalm Beach County leaders made it very clear that people who opt out of using the shelter won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t be allowed to continue camping at parks, while advocates for the homeless feel for the plan to work, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to come down to how it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s presented to the people who will use it.\n\nHomeless resident David Thorton Jr., like dozens of others living in tents at John Prince Park, says he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s thrilled to hear about the access to resources to help him get back on his feet, but he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not completely sold on the plan. He said:\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIf it looks like a jail\u201a\u00c4\u00b6 I feel like they are just trying to lock up the homeless because they think that we are lower than scum. I understand that it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not meant to be [a] luxurious thing, but if it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s like a jail that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s kind of pointless. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s making us look like we are ex-cons and stuff.\u201a\u00c4\u00f92\n\nSources:\n\nShares"

A State-By-State Guide\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mark Lennihan/AP Mark Lennihan/AP\n\nEvery U.S. state has implemented restrictions designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. Businesses reduced or ceased operations, people transitioned into working and learning remotely, and nonessential activities were paused. At least temporarily, much of the country was under strict orders to stay home.\n\nState officials are now charting paths to a new normal, seeking a balance between reopening economies and protecting public health. Many governors are outlining new frameworks and timelines for their states as they ramp up testing and contact tracing efforts. Some have also formed regional partnerships to coordinate economic recovery. Most are releasing general and industry-specific reopening guidelines for businesses and individuals.\n\nPresident Trump's federal guidelines for social distancing and mitigation expired on May 1. Many states are modifying stay-at-home orders, prolonging school closures or delaying elections until after that date. Many are also lifting certain restrictions as they embark on phased-in recovery plans. And while more than half of states have partially reopened, public health experts say that some are doing so too quickly, as they warn of a second wave of infections. At a May 12 Senate hearing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S.'s top infectious disease expert, expressed concern about some states and localities skipping federal guidelines to open prematurely.\n\nGovernors have created their own data dashboards and task forces to guide their planning, and provide regular progress updates. Conditions and predictions differ across states, though there is broad consensus that reopening will not happen overnight.\n\nEach day brings changes. NPR is tracking developments in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia so you can see what's changed and how states compare.\n\nHere's what each one has done so far, by region:\n\nNortheast: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont\n\nMidwest: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Wisconsin\n\nSouth: Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia\n\nWest: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming\n\nThe first version of this page was originally published on March 12.

The concert notification service can now push out a \u201a\u00c4\u00fawatch live\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 notification when musicians are live-streaming shows. These notifications will appear on Bandsintown, along with Facebook pages, Instagram Stories, and other places that surface Bandsintown listings.\n\nTwitch is increasingly becoming a popular place for indie musicians to make money amid the pandemic. With touring essentially at a standstill, many are looking to online platforms in order to try and recoup lost funds from shows.\n\nAdditionally, Bandsintown has launched its own Twitch channel, with all proceeds going to the MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund. The first show features South African DJ Black Coffee and will stream at 1PM ET today.\n\nBandsintown says it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s starting the channel both to connect artists with fans while many are stuck at home and to help raise more funds for MusiCares through Twitch. There are a bunch of ways to financially support streamers on Twitch, as longtime Twitch user Ducky told The Verge yesterday. Users can subscribe to channels or tip small amounts, and Amazon Prime members are able to subscribe to one channel per month for free.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faAs true music fans, there are ways you can help us help artists,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 reads Bandsintown\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s announcement. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re able to, avoid asking for refunds, buy their merch, attend their live shows when they return, donate to tips jars, or donate to MusiCares.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nMusiCares is an arm of the Recording Academy that provides financial relief to those in the music industry facing unexpected hardships. (Disclosure: I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m the vice president of the Chicago chapter of the Recording Academy.) With many musicians currently unable to tour and out of work, the organization recently launched a separate fund specifically for artists and other industry professionals affected by the pandemic.\n\nBandsintown says its next live stream is scheduled for next week, and it will be a multiday live music marathon featuring both emerging and established artists."

                    "article_title": "These Lab Animals Will Help Fight Coronavirus",
                    "article_content": "\nAmong the many lessons of the coronavirus pandemic is how close humans are to the rest of the animal kingdom. We get diseases from other animals, and then we use more animals to figure out how to stop the diseases. As research ramps up treatments and vaccines, animals are crucial to fighting the pandemic.\nThere are different animals at each end of the pandemic, of course. The new disease almost certainly began with a bat virus, scientists agree. That virus probably passed through another animal, perhaps pangolins, on its way to humans.\nBut the animals that scientists will depend on in the lab are mice, first of all, and then perhaps ferrets or hamsters or monkeys. Around the world, different laboratories are racing to breed stocks of mice genetically engineered for research and testing the susceptibility of other animals to infection with the virus that causes Covid-19.\nThere are, of course, many objections to animal testing, particularly when it comes to primates, but researchers are deeply concerned about the hazards to humans of treatments or vaccines that have not been tried on other animals first.\nNo single kind of animal will serve all test purposes and scientists have several criteria for what makes an animal useful in testing therapies and vaccines for effectiveness.\nFirst, it must be susceptible to infection, and not all animals are. Despite the quarantining of one dog in Hong Kong, with a \u201a\u00c4\u00faweak positive\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 test for coronavirus, various health agencies are not taking a single, ambiguous result as evidence for concern. Advisories state there is no evidence yet that pets are susceptible to the disease.\nAnd even when laboratory animals are susceptible to infection, that doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t mean they get sick. \u201a\u00c4\u00faMost of them, they don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t care at all that they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re infected,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a microbiologist at the University of Iowa who developed a mouse in 2003 that was susceptible to infection with the SARS virus. It is called the hACE2 mouse.\nIf an animal doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t get sick from the infection, its use is limited, because testing treatment effectiveness requires observing whether the treatment stops the symptoms.\nThe best laboratory animal would not only get infected and get sick, but get sick in the same way that humans do, showing a similar course of disease. Then a test would give the most information.\nDr. Perlman pointed out that the hACE2 strain of mice susceptible to SARS got sick, \u201a\u00c4\u00fabut developed a brain disease\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in addition to other symptoms. A new study from China, not yet peer-reviewed, suggests that these mice do get infected with the new pandemic virus, which is called SARS-CoV-2, and develop mild pneumonia. The paper made no mention of the virus affecting the brain.\nThis strain of mice will be used in some of the first laboratory experiments. But first it is necessary to breed them. Like many other genetically engineered mice varieties, scientists don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t keep live colonies on hand. Instead the mice\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s frozen sperm and embryos are kept ready.\nThe hACE2 mice were put on ice when the SARS outbreak stopped in the early 2000s. Chien-Te Tseng at the University of Texas Medical Branch, who independently developed an hACE2 mouse, is now building up a colony from frozen embryos in his lab. Mice have a three-week gestation period, or pregnancy, and take eight weeks to reach sexual maturity.\nDr. Perlman is not rejuvenating the strain himself. He sent 16 vials of frozen sperm to the Jackson Laboratory in Maine, one of the biggest breeders of laboratory animals, so they can ramp up their production.\nThey hope to have mice ready for distribution, at cost, by May, according to Cat Lutz, director of the mouse repository, with responsibility for thousands of strains of mice, including the hACE2.\nThe advantage of this strain is that it has a human receptor on its cells called an ACE2 receptor, thus its name. That allows it to be infected with SARS and the new coronavirus, which both target that receptor as they try to invade cells.\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThere\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a huge demand,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Dr. Lutz said, \u201a\u00c4\u00fanot only in the United States, but globally.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9Dr. Lutz said that researchers at the Jackson Laboratory will also be investigating other ways to make mice more susceptible to the new coronavirus.\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThere\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s never only one mouse model that we use.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 For diabetes she said, \u201a\u00c4\u00fawe have eight different models that we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll look at depending on the answer that we want to ask. And I think the same is going to be true in this circumstance as well.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\nDr. Michael Diamond, in infectious disease specialist at Washington University in St. Louis, is also planning to do research with the hACE2 mouse, and other strains.\nHe said that although mice take time to breed, creating a supply of them is still quicker than using larger animals. Mice, he said, may help scientists \u201a\u00c4\u00fato sort of winnow down some of the candidates\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 for vaccines.\nDr. Diamond also said that groups around the globe are pursuing many of the same goals. At first it might seem redundant, but because there are so many unanticipated problems that arise in vaccine and treatment tests, redundancy is a feature of the scientific process rather than a drawback.\nInevitably, he said, vaccine and treatment researchers will move to other animals, perhaps hamsters and ferrets, but certainly monkeys, which are most likely to replicate how the disease progresses in humans. All work with the live virus takes place in level 3 biosecure labs, Dr. Diamond said.\nDave O\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Connor, a pathologist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, is working with colleagues to test the usefulness of monkeys in the study of coronavirus treatments. He said that a Chinese group had already published some data on rhesus macaques and he had heard that more results from other labs around the world would be coming soon.\nThose results would be on the suitability of primates for laboratory tests, not on immediate cures. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis is not the movie \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Contagion\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 where there will be a magic discovery in a monkey that allows everyone to recover immediately,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said.\nHe added that, \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe are potentially going to be dealing with this for a really long time and need to come to better terms with that.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9"

                    "article_content": "Comments by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nThere has been a debate going on in healthcare for more than 100 years. It started in the 1800s when two competing points of view were put forward to explain disease, and the cause of disease.\n\nFrench medical scientist Louis Pasteur wrote on the \u201a\u00c4\u00fagerm theory\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of disease, while his French contemporary, Antoine B\u221a\u00a9champ promoted a theory of \u201a\u00c4\u00faterrain,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 or sometimes referred to as the \u201a\u00c4\u00facellular theory.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe following chart highlights some of the differences between the two theories:\n\nAn objective, critical review of each theory can find some merit to each approach.\n\nFor example, Pasteur\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s work on unseen germs led to a change in practice for surgeons of the day, and many credit the work of Scottish doctor Joseph Lister for starting the practice of requiring surgeons to wash and disinfect their hands prior to surgery. Hospital-induced infections such as sepsis dropped so dramatically, that the practice of sterilization spread to surgical equipment as well.\n\nBut as an overall model for disease and health, many feel that Pasteur\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s germ theory of disease overstates things in a reductionist sort of way that misses much in disease treatment. Holistic doctors today who supplement their medical training based mostly on the germ theory of disease, tend to follow the work originally put forth by B\u221a\u00a9champ that the \u201a\u00c4\u00faterrian,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 more commonly referred to today as the body\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faimmune system,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 is much more important and effective in treating or curing disease.\n\nThe evidence to support this theory is that pathogens affect everyone differently, not the same. Even during some of the most deadly recorded \u201a\u00c4\u00faplagues\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 or \u201a\u00c4\u00fapandemics\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in history, some people succumbed, while others did not. Usually those who survived far outnumber those who died, leading to the theory that the immune system is the key factor in not only fighting disease, but preventing it in the first place.\n\nOf course today\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s medical system is NOT focused on prevention by building up the body\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s immune system, as there is no profit from that. Today\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s multi-TRILLION dollar medical industry needs sick patients to treat to remain economically viable. Well patients don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t provide the same profit. See:\n\nBut just as Dr. Joseph Lister put into practice Pastuer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s theory of germs with great success in reducing hospital deaths, which might be great for preventing the deaths of patients already sick and is more of a \u201a\u00c4\u00fahygiene\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 protocol than a health protocol, so too many physicians today are putting into practice methods that more closely follow B\u221a\u00a9champ\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s theories by bolstering the body\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s immune system with great success in treating disease.\n\nOne such doctor that we have featured many times here on Health Impact News, is Dr. David Brownstein from the Center For Holistic Medicine in Michigan.\n\nDr. Brownstein has just published a report where he is claiming that his clinic has treated 85 patients for COVID-19 and that none of them have died, and none of them had to be hospitalized. He has also video recorded some of their testimonies.\n\nSo what treatment protocols did Dr. Brownstein use for this kind of success rate?\n\n85 COVID Patients at The Center for Holistic Medicine: Zero Hospitalizations and No Deaths\n\nby Dr. Brownstein\n\nAt my office, the Center for Holistic Medicine (CHM), we have had 85 COVID patients. At this time, no one has been hospitalized, no one has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and there have been no deaths.\n\nThere are five practitioners at CHM: Drs. Brownstein, Ng, Nusbaum, Jenny Drummond, PA, and Taylor Easson, NP. Since the start of the COVID-19 crisis, I have been asking my partners how their COVID patients are doing.\n\nAs of this week, we have had 85 patients either diagnosed with COVID or suspected COVID. I am pleased to report that our patients are doing well with this illness. (Note, since new guidelines have come out stating that any suspected COVID patient can be diagnosed with COVID, I am lumping COVID and suspected COIVD patients together for this post.)\n\nI first reported to you about COVID on January 26, 2020. That was the first time I presented our protocol of using vitamins A, C, D, and iodine not only to support the immune system but also to treat viral infections.\n\nIn that post, I also pointed out how important eating a healthy diet is. The importance of using intravenous nutrient therapy, especially vitamin C, was mentioned.\n\nFinally, I suggested that, with coronavirus, it would be wise not to get a flu vaccine since the flu vaccine has been shown to significantly increase the risk of coronavirus and other flu-like viral infections.\n\nThat post seems like a lifetime ago even though it was only 10 weeks ago. During that time period, my message has not changed. In fact, after witnessing the results our patients have experienced, I am more convinced than ever that a holistic approach like I presented above should be the first-line treatment provided to any COVID patient.\n\nThe human body is a true wonder. Given the proper support, it can do wonders. And, when the body is healthy, it can withstand and overcome an infectious illness like COVID.\n\nThe initial conventional approach to COVID was to encourage people to wash their hands (a good thing). As things worsened, the only other conventional idea was to quarantine. When the disease spun out of control our Government and conventional medicine panicked. They had no real therapies to help COVID-suffering patients except for supportive care.\n\nThankfully, a few conventional therapies, like hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, have been promoted\u201a\u00c4\u00eethough many in conventional medicine were downplaying it for far too long.\n\nAt my office, we were ready . The first 24 years of practicing holistic medicine was our time to figure out what worked and what did not work for people suffering from viral infections. That set us up to be ready for this pandemic.\n\nIn my blogs, I encouraged people to take high doses of vitamins A, C, D, and iodine at the first sign of an illness. In our practice, this was sufficient for the majority of our COVID patients. I (and my partners) have no doubt that the vast majority of COVID patients would avoid a deterioration of their symptoms if they started this protocol at the onset of symptoms.\n\nHowever, some became more ill or did not start the oral supplements early enough into their illness. Those patients needed additional holistic therapies. These included nebulizing hydrogen peroxide and iodine along with intravenous nutrient therapies.\n\nTo protect our staff and healthy patients, we did not treat sick COVID patients inside my office. We were gowning up and meeting our patients at their automobile at the back of our building and administering IVs and ozone therapies. Some of these patients were very sick. So far, they all recovered. I have shared some of their stories via a skype interview on previous blog posts.\n\nTo watch a few of our patient testimonials go to:\n\nThere Is Still Hope Out There (3/28/20): Christopher\n\nThere Is Still Hope Out There (3/30/20): Jeremiah\n\nThere Is Still Hope Out There (4/05/20): Kendra\n\nI think the end is in sight. We seem to be crossing over the hump of this dreadful disease. I have no doubt we will be in a much better position over the coming two weeks.\n\nFolks, I hope the Powers-That-Be learn from this catastrophe. In the future, we need to focus on supporting the host rather than conventional medicine\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s focus on killing the infectious organism. We do not have a vaccine or any other conventional therapy that is successful at destroying COVID.\n\nIn the future, I can guarantee you there will be other infectious illnesses that conventional medicine has no treatment to offer. Instead of waiting for the hail-Mary from conventional medicine, it is better to be prepared and have your body ready to fight back. This can be achieved by following my original instructions; eat a healthy diet, maintain optimal hydration, exercise, and correct nutrient imbalances with vitamin and mineral supplementation.\n\nIf you don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have a holistic doctor, it is past time to find one. At my office, we are happy to see you or do a telemed appointment. If you are interested in this please email Ann Salomon at info@centerforholisticmedicine.com.\n\nA holistic doctor can help you achieve your optimal health. Conventional doctors, on the other hand, are busy diagnosing pathology and prescribing the drug to treat that diagnosis. The problem with the conventional model is that the drug prescribed does not promote health as nearly all drugs poison enzymes and block receptors in the body.\n\nThere is a time and a place for drug therapies, but they are well over-prescribed in the US. The use of many drug therapies leaves the body depleted of vital nutrients that it will need when confronted with something like COVID.\n\nAs I previously stated, the Center for Holistic Medicine currently has 85 COVID patients who are all doing well and have not been hospitalized. There were some I was worried about\u201a\u00c4\u00eethey kept me up at night. I called them daily to monitor their progress.\n\nHaving them increase the frequency of nebulizing hydrogen peroxide and iodine helped them all. Some of the sickest were advised to nebulize every hour or two for a short period. IV therapies and ozone treatments have helped many.\n\nThis therapy has worked for helping COVID patients. It is sad that hospitalized COVID patients are not given the proper nutritional support when they are admitted.\n\nIn a perfect world, I would immediately start an IV of vitamin C and begin nebulizing any hospitalized COVID patient with hydrogen peroxide and iodine. I am sure that would markedly lower the need for mechanical ventilation.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nLike most holistic therapies, the earlier they are started in a disease process the better they perform. AT THE FIRST SIGN OF A VIRAL ILLNESS I ENCOURAGE MY PATIENTS TO START MY VIRAL PROTOCOL OF TAKING VITAMINS A, C, D AND IODINE. Due to the severity of COVID, I now recommend starting to nebulize hydrogen peroxide and iodine early into the illness as well.\n\nBetter times are coming. Keep me updated on how you are doing. I will much more to talk about in relation to COVID. More posts will be coming soon.\n\nTo All Our Health,\n\n~DrB\n\nSource."

                    "article_content": "Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s measures of success. But after a manic 3\u00ac\u03a9 years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.\n\nBy far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not going to play that game,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re not uniform across states and across countries.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBut even beyond the death count, there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the official said.\n\nSome Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t been able to focus on getting the response right.\n\nTrump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSo it is a war and I define victory when it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 he said on May 1. \u201a\u00c4\u00faIt can never be a total victory because too many people have died.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nWhen American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.\n\nOthers are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAllowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 argued one Republican close to the president.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Sen. Lindsey Graham\n\nBut, he added, \u201a\u00c4\u00faIf things don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t look like they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re bouncing back by September, I think that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to be a problem.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe fear that Trump can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.\n\nWhen asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the \u201a\u00c4\u00faeconomic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nA spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.\n\nOthers are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)"

When the curtains fell on March 11, 2020, nobody knew that performance was going to be the musical's final bow on Broadway.\n\nNot only does this signify Broadway's first permanent closure due to the novel coronavirus, the news sets an uncertain future for many musicals considering how successful \"Frozen\" was.\n\nOver 1.3 million people turned up to watch Anna, Elsa, Olaf and Kristoff on the stage; the musical grossed over $150 million during its nearly two-year run. It was also nominated for the Best Musical Tony Award.\n\n\"I have to acknowledge our incredible audiences; night after night, the fans showed us how much they loved this show and we look forward to seeing them at 'Frozen' around the world,\" Schumacher concluded.\n\nTickets for the Broadway musical purchased via Ticketmaster will be refunded. Those who used other channels to secure tickets should contact their vendor.\n\nWhile its run on Broadway has come to an end, a future North American tour for \"Frozen\" is in the works. In addition, starting next year, the Disney musical will open in Australia, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom.\n\nDisney is the parent company of ABC News and \"Good Morning America.\""

Some have transitioned to working from home, others are required to venture out each day to \u201a\u00c4\u00faessential\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 workplaces, and many are experiencing unemployment.\n\nWe took to the streets (while maintaining a 6-foot distance) to ask Chicago residents about their \u201a\u00c4\u00fanew normal\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 amid the coronavirus pandemic. Here\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s what they had to say:\n\nRicardo Davila, engineer\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m an electrical engineer, we do the sign and planning of different facilities. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been under self quarantine for the past couple of weeks which means I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been working from home. I typically do not do that. I avoid going outside at all costs but its a little bit hard to keep myself locked up all day. What I do is take moments like this to take a little break and go outside for a five minute, 10 minute walk. I keep myself away from people. I do not go to any public places where people could be and just keep some sort of healthy habits in my daily routine.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faMe personally, I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m an extrovert. I like to be around people, to talk to people. I love to talk to people so it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s been tough but I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been trying to identify that and be like I need to have discipline.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nJason, college student\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI think this is the first time I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve left my house since probably two weeks. I think it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s important to keep practicing social distancing even when you are out. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m trying to avoid visiting places and talking to other people. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m sure my mental health has declined staying inside the last two weeks. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s messing with my education. I haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t been able to go to school in three weeks now.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t even think things will really go back to normal, the way they were before this. It just changed the whole narrative for everything. It changed everything pretty much.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nNycole Stoudt, Service industry employee\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI work in the restaurant industry so we were kind of early on shut downs. I think everybody is a little nervous about what they are going to do to pay their bills, rent especially. We have zoom cocktail hours set up for later this evening to kind of bring everybody together and just say hi to each other.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe Sunday when Governor [J.B.] Pritzker announced restaurants and bars would be closing, that was a big moment for me where it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s like ok things are really going to change drastically and we all need to take the steps necessary to quell any further passing on of the virus to others. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s boring but it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not the worst thing in the world to have to stay in a little bit more.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nKaren and Richard Shapiro, retired\n\nKS: \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m 73 and he\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 76, we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re healthy. I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think about it. I kind of feel like by now if we don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have it we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re all carriers. I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s anybody who is not a carrier. I just use that mindset and be careful.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nRS: \u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not concerned at all. There\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s so many people they haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t tested so they really don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know how extensive this could be, but they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re getting there.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nKS: \u201a\u00c4\u00faWe\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ll get through it.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nJoanna Griffin, Healthcare worker\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faUnfortunately I have to come out to defeat the battle and help the team out as much as possible. This is part of being in healthcare. For the team that I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m working for they are understaffed right now but everyone is just really trying to be optimistic and do the first thing first, making sure we take care of the patients.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been doing about five days a week and I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been going by METRA. The perfect thing about this is there aren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t too many people on the train. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not too bad. I had my concerns making sure they are clean on the trains. METRA is very good about that. I have no concerns about that, I know they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve definitely been doing their part of safety first.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nBarry DeBois, Actor/Singer\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI was bartending between those things and then I quit my bartending job to start a theater gig and then that got canceled because all theater is being canceled at the moment. I still have to pay rent.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faBasically I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m trying to take gigs where I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m keeping my distance from people but those are very limited jobs. I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve talked to friends in the theater community and they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re doing different stuff. Some people are teaching english to people in China. There are a lot of remote teaching opportunities people have gotten into.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIf I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m not working in theater I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m working in the service industry and both of those are demolished right now. So I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know when I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m going to make normal money again which is kind of scary. We just moved into this new, beautiful apartment.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nTamas Vilaghy, Service industry employee\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI work at a wine shop and there was a bar component which has shut we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re figuring out if we can do take out and carry out and delivery. The wine shop has remained open so that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s giving me a little bit of income.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faI live with my wife so it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nice to have someone there. We take a walk at night but that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s about it. She\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a musician so all of her gigs have dried up. She\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s trying to teach over zoom right now but it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s uncertain as well whether or not that can continue. The teachers I know are at a loss about this too.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9"

That is an increase of 1,347 cases from Thursday to Friday. The new numbers have not yet been recorded for Saturday.\n\nLast Friday, the daily case increase was 1,219.\n\nRegistered nurse April Lewis, center, prepares to administer a test at a newly opened United Memorial Medical Center COVID-19 drive-thru testing site, April 27, 2020, in Houston. David J. Phillip/AP\n\nWhile the cases are still well below New York, the state with the most confirmed cases at more than 345,000, the steady increase shows that the curve has not yet flattened in Texas.\n\nThe state also experienced its highest and second-highest daily death toll just a day apart. On Thursday, 58 deaths were recorded in 24 hours and Friday that number dropped only slightly to 56, according to the health department. The total number of fatalities is at 1,272.\n\nLast Friday, the daily death toll was 31.\n\nHospitalizations rates have appeared to flatten, but that data is reported on a two-week lag. Currently there are 1,716 people in a Texas hospital, according to the health department.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott's communications director John Wittman told ABC News that the amount of testing has doubled since reopening, contributing to the rise in cases.\n\n\"Since [COVID-19 testing] started, we did 330,000 tests in March and April. Since May 1, we have done over 330,000 -- so in 16 days we have doubled our testing from the previous entire two months,\" Wittman said.\n\n\"The governor has been clear that as the state of Texas conducts more tests, we will see the raw number of cases rise,\" Wittman said. \"However, the [rolling seven-day] average positivity rate has steadily declined from our high April 13 [of a bit more than 13%] to around 5% today. Our hospitalizations remain steady, and Texas has one of the lowest death rates per capita in the nation.\"\n\nTexas began reopening after its stay-at-home order was lifted on April 30.\n\nRestaurants are open for in-person dining at 25% capacity. Movie theaters and malls are also open at 25% capacity.\n\nMen receive haircuts as social distancing guidelines to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are relaxed at Doug's Barber Shop in Houston, Texas, May 8, 2020. Callaghan O'hare/Reuters\n\nRetail stores, libraries and museums are fully open. Come Monday, gyms will reopen too.\n\nThe two most populous counties -- Harris and Dallas -- have recorded the most cases. There are 8,817 confirmed cases in Harris County and 6,837 confirmed cases in Dallas County.\n\nThe state has tested nearly 646,000 people out of a population of 29 million. Cases are most likely higher because of how few people have been tested.\n\nABC News' Ali Dukakis contributed to this report.\n\nEditor's note: ABC News has updated this story to include comments from Gov. Greg Abbott's communications director."

Gretchen Whitmer\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s administration before his visit to the Ford plant:\n\nFord will not threaten Trump with an ultimatum to wear the mask. Trump has avoided wearing a mask during public appearances, showing that he will not succumb to the mass hysteria. The president is setting an example for ordinary Americans to overcome the media-induced panic. \u201a\u00c4\u00faAs we have said previously, we shared our safety policies and recommendations with the White House in advance of this visit. The White House has its own safety and testing policies in place and will make its own determination,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Ford said in a statement. Trump has refused the advice of the deep state bureaucracy, which wants to scare people into wearing masks. The mask has emerged as a sign of cowardice and obsequiousness throughout the pandemic. \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe CDC is advising the use of non-medical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure. So it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s voluntary. You don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have to do it. But they suggest it for a period of time. I don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t think I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m going to be doing it,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Trump said.\n\nBecause Nessel cannot do anything against Trump other than whine, she may attempt to punish the Ford plant and put more people on the unemployment line due to her tantrum."

                    "article_title": "Democrats push new $3T coronavirus relief bill through House",
                    "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u201a\u00c4\u00ee Democrats have powered a massive $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill through the House, an election-year measure designed to brace a U.S. economy in free fall and a health care system struggling to contain a pandemic still pummeling the country.\n\nFriday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s 208-199 vote, with all but one Republican opposed, advances what boils down to a campaign-season display of Democratic economic and health-care priorities. It has no chance of becoming law as written, but will likely spark difficult negotiations with the White House and Senate Republicans. Any product would probably be the last major COVID-19 response bill before November\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s presidential and congressional elections.\n\nThe enormous Democratic measure would cost more than the prior four coronavirus bills combined. It would deliver almost $1 trillion for state and local governments, another round of $1,200 direct payments to individuals and help for the unemployed, renters and homeowners, college debt holders and the struggling Postal Service.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faNot to act now is not only irresponsible in a humanitarian way, it is irresponsible because it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s only going to cost more,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 warned House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. \u201a\u00c4\u00faMore in terms of lives, livelihood, cost to the budget, cost to our democracy.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nRepublicans mocked the bill as a bloated Democratic wish-list that was dead on arrival in the GOP-led Senate and, for good measure, faced a White House veto threat. Party leaders say they want to assess how $3 trillion approved earlier is working and see if some states\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 partial business reopenings would spark an economic revival that would ease the need for more safety net programs.\n\nRepublicans are also sorting through internal divisions and awaiting stronger signals from President Donald Trump about what he will support.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faPhase Four is going to happen,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, using Washington insider-speak for the measure. \u201a\u00c4\u00faBut it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s going to happen in a much better way for the American people.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nTrump and top Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are insisting the next measure should protect reopening businesses from liability lawsuits. The president is also demanding a cut to payroll taxes, but GOP leaders are not yet onboard.\n\nThe daylong debate painted a Capitol scene that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s become common in the era of coronavirus, even as it remains disconcerting. The sparsely populated House floor was dotted with lawmakers and aides wearing protective masks and even gloves, though some Republicans lacked them.\n\nMany members looked shaggier and sported beards they had not worn weeks ago. Roll call votes lasted over an hour each because lawmakers were voting in small groups to limit crowding.\n\nTo enhance the bill\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s political impact, Democrats named their measure \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe Heroes Act\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 for the payments it would provide front-line emergency workers. With more than 86,000 Americans dead, 1.4 million confirmed infections and 36 million filing unemployment claims in an frozen economy, Democrats saw GOP opposition as an easy campaign-season target.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faAre you kidding me?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, of Republican assertions that it was time to stop spending more money. \u201a\u00c4\u00faWhere do you guys live? Food lines at our food banks around the block? In the United States of America?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nRepublicans saw the bill as a Democratic political blunder. They said overly generous unemployment benefits discouraged people from returning to work, and attacked language helping immigrants in the U.S. illegally get federal benefits. They also singled out provisions helping states set up voting by mail and easing the marijuana industry\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s access to banks.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faIt may help the cannabis industry, but it won\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t help Main Street,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\n\nPelosi pushed the measure through after overcoming party divisions aggravated by election pressures. Some moderate Democrats opposed the package for its price tag and politically fraught provisions like assisting marijuana businesses. A few progressive Democrats were upset because it did not do more, such as guaranteeing workers\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 salaries and bolstering their health insurance coverage.\n\nFourteen Democrats voted against the measure. Nearly all are centrists and number among the party\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s most vulnerable lawmakers in November\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s elections: freshmen from districts Trump won in 2016.\n\nAmong them was Rep. Cindy Axne of Iowa, who labeled the measure \u201a\u00c4\u00fabloated.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 Another, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, tweeted, \u201a\u00c4\u00faThis bill strays far beyond delivering relief or responding to an urgent crisis, & it has no chance at becoming law.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nRepublicans were already planning to use the day\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s votes against other moderate Democrats who backed Friday\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s legislation and face competitive reelection races.\n\nClearly, the bipartisan consensus that produced four previous coronavirus bills was crumbling quickly. Polls show GOP voters are satisfied with the federal response and aren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t agitating for more. Self-branded deficit hawks are citing the massive increase in the spiraling $25 trillion national debt.\n\nSome congressional aides said the Democratic bill\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s real price tag could breach $3.5 trillion. A partial estimate of tax provisions alone revealed eye-popping costs: $412 billion to renew $1,200 cash payments to individuals, more than $100 billion to pay health insurance premiums for the unemployed and $164 billion to make an \u201a\u00c4\u00faemployee retention\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 tax credit for businesses more generous.\n\nRepublicans leaders faced disunity between conservatives who feel enough has been done and pragmatists who back rescuing the Postal Service from looming insolvency and delivering cash to revenue-starved state and local governments. The huge price tag and a lack of consultation with Republicans by Pelosi cemented GOP opposition.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThis bill is nothing more than the Democratic policy agenda masquerading as a response to the coronavirus crisis,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla. He said the bill is \u201a\u00c4\u00fagoing nowhere, and is going nowhere fast.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nLiberal Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., also opposed the bill. She told reporters that if constituents ask her if the bill would put money in their pockets or preserve their health care, \u201a\u00c4\u00faI can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t tell them yes.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe lone Republican backing the legislation was Rep. Peter King of New York, who is retiring."

A GoFundMe fundraiser has raised over $200,000.\n\nCordero played a mob soldier with a flair for the dramatic in 2014 in Broadway\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Woody Allen 1994 film adaptation of \u201a\u00c4\u00faBullets Over Broadway,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 for which he received a Tony nomination for best featured actor in a musical. He moved to Los Angeles to star in \u201a\u00c4\u00faRock of Ages.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe lanky Cordero originated the menacing role of husband Earl opposite his estranged wife, played by Jessie Mueller, in \u201a\u00c4\u00faWaitress\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 on Broadway, as well as the role of Sonny in Chazz Palminteri\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s \u201a\u00c4\u00faA Bronx Tale.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nOn the small screen, Cordero appeared in several episodes of \u201a\u00c4\u00faBlue Bloods\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00faLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 as well as \u201a\u00c4\u00faLilyhammer\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and he had a role in the film \u201a\u00c4\u00faGoing in Style.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\nThe virus has sickened other Broadway veterans, including the actors Danny Burstein, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Gavin Creel, Aaron Tveit and Laura Bell Bundy as well as composer David Bryan. It has also claimed the life of Tony-winning playwright Terrence McNally."
