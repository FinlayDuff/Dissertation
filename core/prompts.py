        Here are some examples:

        Example 1:
        Article: "Eating chocolate every day has been proven to cure cancer in multiple studies. Scientists recommend everyone to include chocolate in their daily diet to stay cancer-free."
        Label: Fake
        Explanation: The claim that eating chocolate can cure cancer is unsupported and misleading. There is no credible scientific evidence to back this assertion, and such a statement contradicts well-established cancer research. The article also lacks citations from reputable medical sources to support the claims made.

        Example 2:
        Article: "The Mediterranean diet has been linked to a lower risk of heart disease in multiple studies. A report published by the American Heart Association highlights the benefits of this diet, which includes a high intake of fruits, vegetables, and olive oil."
        Label: Credible
        Explanation: The article is well-supported by evidence from reputable sources, including a report from the American Heart Association. Numerous studies have shown a link between the Mediterranean diet and lower heart disease risk, making the article's claims credible.

        Example 3:
        Article: "The only reason the government pushes for vaccinations is because they are in the pockets of big pharmaceutical companies, and they don't care about our health. It's all about profit and control."
        Label: Fake
        Explanation: This article contains strong bias and polarising language, suggesting a conspiracy without presenting credible evidence. It makes unfounded claims about government motivations and pharmaceutical companies, while also failing to provide any reputable sources to substantiate these accusations. The tone is divisive and lacks factual support.

        Example 4:
        Article: "Vaccines have been instrumental in eradicating diseases like smallpox, and the World Health Organization (WHO) continues to recommend vaccinations for preventing outbreaks of diseases such as measles and polio."
        Label: Credible
        Explanation: This article is based on verifiable historical facts and aligns with the consensus of public health authorities like the WHO. The role of vaccines in eradicating smallpox and controlling diseases like measles and polio is well-documented in scientific and medical literature, making this article credible.

        Example 5:
        Article: "You must stop using mobile phones immediately! Studies have shown that radiation from mobile phones is killing millions of brain cells daily. Protect yourself by switching off your devices permanently."
        Label: Fake
        Explanation: The claim that mobile phone radiation kills millions of brain cells daily is exaggerated and unsupported by credible scientific evidence. While there are ongoing studies on mobile phone radiation, reputable organisations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) have not confirmed any such drastic health risks. Additionally, the article uses a fear-based call to action without proper substantiation.

        Example 6:
        Article: "While research on mobile phone radiation is ongoing, the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified it as 'possibly carcinogenic'. However, current evidence does not conclusively prove that mobile phone use is harmful to human health, and further studies are needed."
        Label: Credible
        Explanation: This article presents a balanced and factual report, acknowledging both the ongoing research and the current classification by the WHO. It avoids exaggeration and provides a well-supported explanation, making it credible.
